### Internet Protocol #ip 
- IP uses packets to carry information through the network
	- A packet is a self-contained, independent entity that contains data and sufficient information to be routed from the source to the destination without reliance on previous packets
- IP has these characteristics:
	- Operates at Layer 3 or the network layer of OSI reference model and at the Internet layer of the TCP/IP stack
	- Connectionless protocol
		- One way packet is sent to the destination without advance notification to the destination device
		- Destination device receives the data and does not return any status information to the sending device
	- Each packet is treated independently, can travel a different way to the destination
		- Also operates independently of the medium that is carrying the data
	- Uses hierarchical addressing, network identification is the equivalent of a street, host ID is equivalent of a house or office building on the street
	- Provides service on a best-effort basis and does not guarantee packet delivery
		- Packet can be misdirected, duplicated or lost on the way to its destination
	- Does not provide any special features that recover corrupted packets
		- The end systems of the network provide these services
	- IPv4 and IPv6, IPv6 becoming increasingly important in modern networks
