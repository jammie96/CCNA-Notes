### IPv4 Address Exhaustion Workarounds
- IPv4 provides approximately 4 billion unique addresses 
	- Still not enough to keep up with the growth of the internet
- To extend the lifetime and usefulness of IPv4 and to circumvent the address shortage, several mechanisms were created:
	- Classless interdomain routing (CIDR)
	- Variable-length subnet masking (VLSM)
	- Network Address Translation (NAT)
	- Private IPv4 addresses space (RFC 1918)
- Over the years, hardware support has been added to devices to support IPv4 enhancements through Application Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs)
	- This offloads processing from the equipment CPU to network hardware
		- Allows more simultaneous transmission and higher bandwidth utilization

**CIDR** #CIDR
- CIDR allows the address space to be divided into smaller blocks, varying in size depending on the number of hosts needed in individual blocks
	- These blocks are no longer associated with predefined IPv4 addresses classes, such as class A, B and C
	- Instead, the allocation includes a subnet mask or prefix length, which defines the size of the block

**VLSM** #VLSM
- VLSM allows more efficient use of IPv4 addresses, specifically on small segments, such as point-to-point serial links
- VLSM usage was recommended in RFC 1817
- CIDR and VLSM support was a prerequisite for ISPs to improve the scalability of the routing on the internet

**NAT** #NAT
- Introduced a model in which a device facing outward to the internet has a globally routable IPv4 address, while the internal network is configured with private RFC 1918 addresses
	- These private addresses can never be routed outside the site, as they can be identified in many different enterprise networks
- In this way, even large enterprises with thousands of systems can hide behind a few routable public networks
- One of the arguments against deploying IPv6 is that NAT will solve the problems of limited address space in IPv4 #IPv6 
- NAT merely delays the exhaustion of the IPv4 address space
	- Many large organizations and ISPs are moving to IPv6 because they are running out of IPv4 private addresses, e.g. Internet of Things (IoT) devices are added to their networks
- Negative implications of using NAT, some of which are identified in RFC 2775 and RFC2993:
	- NAT breaks the end-to-end model of IP, in which only the endpoints, not the intermediary devices, should process the packets
	- NAT inhibits end-to-end network security
		- To protect the integrity of the IP header by some cryptographic functions, the IP header cannot be changed between the origin of the packet (to protect the integrity of the header) and the final destination (to check the integrity of the received packet)
		- Any translation of parts of a header on the path will break the integrity check
	- When applications are not NAT-friendly, NAT must be embed complete knowledge of the applications to perform correctly
		- For a specific application, more than just the port and address mapping are necessary to forward the packet through the NAT device
			- This is true for dynamically allocated ports, embedded IP addresses in application protocols, security associations and so on
		- Therefore, NAT device needs to be upgraded each time a new non-NAT-friendly application is deployed, e.g. peer-to-peer
	- When different networks use the same private address space and merge or connect, an address space collision occurs
		- Hosts that are different but have the same address cannot communicate with each other
		- There are NAT techniques available to help with this issue but they increase NAT complications

**DHCP** #DHCP
- Used extensively in IPv4 networks to dynamically allocate addresses, typically from private IPv4 addresses space (RFC 1918), then translated to public addresses using NAT

### Ipv6 Features
- Although VLSM, NAT and other workarounds (for avoiding the transition to IPv6) are available, networks with internet connectivity must begin the transition to IPv6 as soon as possible
- For IPv4 networks that provide goods and services to internet users, it is especially important because the transition by the internet community is already underway
- New networks may be unable to acquire IPv4 addresses and networks running IPv6 exclusively will not be able to communicate with IPv4-only networks unless you configure an intermediary gateway or another transition mechanism
- IPv4 and IPv6 are completely separate protocols and IPv6 is not backward compatible with IPv4
- As the internet evolves, organizations must adopt IPv6 to support future business continuity, growth and global expansion
- Furthermore, some ISPs and Regional Internet Registries (RIRs) are administratively out of IPv4 addresses, meaning that their supply of IPv4 addresses is now limited and organizations have to migrate to and support IPv6 networks
![[Pasted image 20241110145459.png]]

- IPv6 includes several features that make it attractive for building global-scale, highly effective networks:
	- Larger address space
		- Provides improved global reachability and flexibility
		- A better aggregation of IP prefixes is announced in the routing tables
		- The aggregation of routing prefixes limits the number of routing table entries, creating efficient and scalable routing tables
		- Multihoming increases the reliability of the internet connection of an IP network
			- With IPv6, a host can have multiple IP addresses over one physical upstream link
				- E.g. a host can connect to several ISPs
		- Autoconfiguration is available
		- There are more plug-and-play options for more devices
		- Simplified mechanisms are available for address renumbering and modification
	- Simpler header
		- Streamlined fixed header structures make the processing of IPv6 packets faster and more efficient for intermediate routers within the network
			- This is true when large number of packets are routed in the core of the IPv6 internet
	- Security and mobility
		- Features that were not part of the original IPv4 specification are now built into IPv6
			- IP Security (IPsec) is available in IPv6, allowing the IPv6 networks to be secure #IPsec
			- Mobility enables mobile network devices to move around in networks without breaks in established network connections
	- Transition richness
		- Includes a rich set of tools to aid in transitioning networks in IPv4, to allow an easy, non-disruptive transition over time to IPv6-dominant networks
			- E.g. dual stacking, in which devices run both IPv4 and IPv6

### IPv6 Addresses and Address Types
- IPv6 addresses consist of 128 bits and are represented as a series of 8 16-bit hexadecimal fields separated by colons
- Although the upper and lowercase is permitted, it is best practice to use lowercase for IPv6 representation
- Address representation:
	- Format is x:x:x:x:X:X:X:X, where x is a 16-bit hexadecimal field
		- E.g. 2001:0db8:010f:0001:0000:0000:0000:00acd
	- Leading zeroes in a field can be omitted
		- E.g. 2001:db8:10f:1:0:0:0:acd
	- Successive fields of 0 are represented as "::" but only once in an address
		- E.g. 2001:db8:10f:1::acd
		- An address parser can identify the number of missing zeroes by separating the 2 parts and filling in zeroes until the 128 bits are completed
			- However if 2 double colons are places, there is no way to identify the size of each block of zeroes
		- The double colons makes many addresses very small
			- E.g. ff01:0:0:0:0:0:0:1 becomes ff01::1
		- All zeroes address is written as a double colon, this type of address representation is known as the unspecified address
	- The a,b,c,d,e,f in hexadecimal fields can either be uppercase or lowercase but it is best to use lowercase for IPv6 representation
		- Although Cisco IOS accepts both lowercase and uppercase, RFC 5952 recommends to represent in lowercase to ensure compatibility with case-sensitive applications

#### IPv6 Address Types
![[Pasted image 20241110163933.png]]

- IPv6 supports 3 basic types of addresses
- Each address type has specific rules regarding its construction and us
	- Unicast
		- Used in a one-to-one context
	- Multicast 
		- Identifies a group of interfaces
		- Traffic that is sent to a multicast address is sent to multiple destinations at the same time
		- An interface may belong to any number of multicast groups
	- Anycast
		- An IPv6 anycast address is assigned to an interface on more than one node
		- When a packet is sent to an anycast address, it is routed to the nearest interface that has this address
			- The nearest interface is found according to the measure of metric of the particular routing protocol #Metric 
		- All nodes that share the same address should behave the same way so that the service is offered similarly, regardless of the node that services the request
- IPv6 does not support broadcast addresses in the way that they are used in IPv4
	- Instead, specific multicast addresses (such as the all-nodes multicast address) are used
- IPv6 unicast addresses are assigned to each node (interface)
	- Their uses are discussed in RFC 4291:

| Address        | Value     | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| -------------- | --------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Global Unicast | 2000::/3  | Assigned by IANA and used on public networks. They are equivalent to IPv4 global (public) addresses. ISPs summarize these to provide scalability on the internet                                                                         |
| Link-local     | fe80::/10 | An automatically configured IPv6 address on an interface, the scope is only on the physical link and is required                                                                                                                         |
| Unique-local   | fc00::/7  | Unique local unicast addresses are analogous to private IPv4 addresses in that they are used for local communications. The scope is the entire site or organization                                                                      |
| Loopback       | ::1       | Link the 127.0.0.1 address in IPv4, ::1 is used for local testing functions. Unlike IPv4, which dedicates a complete class A block of addresses for local testing, IPv6 uses only 1                                                      |
| Unspecified    | ::        | 0.0.0.0 in IPv4 means "unknown" address. In IPv6, this address is represented by :: and is typically used in the source address field of the packet when an interface does not have and address and is trying to acquire one dynamically |

- An IPv6 address prefix, in the format ipv6-prefix/prefix-length, can be used to represent bitwise contiguous blocks of the entire address space
- The prefix length is a decimal value that indicates how many of the high-order contiguous bits of the address compose the prefix
- An IPv6 address network prefix is represented in the same way as the network prefix ( e.g. 10.1.1.0/24 in IPv4)
	- E.g. 2001:db8:8086:6502::/32 is a valid IPv6 prefix
#### IPv6 Address Scopes and Prefixes
- An IPv6 address scope specifies the region of the network in which the address is valid
	- E.g. the link-local address has a scope that is called "link-local", which means that it is valid and should be used on a directly attached network (link)
- Scopes can apply to both unicast and multicast addresses
- There are several different scopes or regions
	- Link scope
	- Organization scope
	- Global network scope

![[Pasted image 20241110193940.png]]

- Addresses in the link scope are called link-local addresses and routers will not forward to these addresses to other links or networks
- Addresses intended to span multiple sites belonging to one organization are called organization-local addresses
	- Addresses in the global network scope are called global unicast addresses
- The IPv6 site-local unicast addresses are deprecated in the RFC 3879

**Multiple IPv6 Addresses on an Interface**
- As with IPv4, IPv6 addresses are assigned to interfaces
	- However, IPv6 interface is expected to have multiple addresses
- The IPv6 addresses that are assigned to an interface can be any of the basic types; unicast, multicast or anycast

**IPv6 Unicast Addresses**
- An IPv6 unicast address generally uses 64 bits for the network ID and 64 bits for the interface ID
- The network ID is administratively assigned and the interface ID can be configured manually or autoconfigured
- When you use Stateless Address AutoConfiguration (SLAAC) IPv6 address assignment method, a 64-bit interface ID is required

**Use or EUI-64 Format Interface ID in IPv6 Addresses**
- The Interface ID in an IPv6 address is analogous to the host portion of an IPv4 address
	- It uniquely identifies an interface on a link
- A 64-bit interface ID is not required but is highly recommended
- However, a 64-bit interface ID is required when an IPv6 address is autoconfigured
- One way to guarantee that the interface ID is unique is to base it on the MAC address of the interface
- The Extended Universal Identifier 64-bit format (EUI-64) defines the method to create an interface identifier from an IEEE 48-bit MAC address
- Sine the EUI-64 format is based on a unique MAC address, using this format, a device can automatically assign itself a unique 64-bit IPv6 interface ID without the need for manual configuration or DHCP
![[Pasted image 20241110194726.png]]
> The EUI-74 format interface ID is derived from the 48-bit MAC address by inserting the hexadecimal number ffe between the upper 3 bytes (OUI field) and the lower 3 vendor assigned bytes of the MAC address
> 	- Then, the seventh but from the left of the first octet, or the universal/local (U/L) bit, is inverted
> 		- This bit defines whether this interface identifier is universally or locally administered
> 	- If after inverting the seventh bit is 0, the address is locally administered and if it's 1, the address is globally unique
> 		- It is worth nothing that in the OUI portion, the globally unique addresses assigned by the IEEE have always been set to 0 whereas the locally created addresses have 1 configured
> 		- Therefore, when the bit is inverted, it maintains its original scope (global unique address is still global unique and vice versa)

**IPv6 Global Unicast Address**
- Both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses are generally assigned in a hierarchical manner
- ISPs assign users IP addresses
- ISPs obtain allocations of IP addresses from a Local Internet Registry (LIR) or National Internet Registry (NIR) or their appropriate RIR
- The RIR, in turn, obtains IP addresses from the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN), the operator for IANA

![[Pasted image 20241110200122.png]]
> The figure shows how address space can be allocated to the RIR and ISP
> 	- These values are minimum allocations, which means that an RIR will get a /23 or shorter, and ISP will get a /32 or shorter and a site will get a /48 or shorter
> 		- A shorter prefix length allows more available address space
> 			- E.g. a site could get a /40 or /48, giving it more addresses to justify to its ISP
> 		- The end customer can also choose a provider-independent address space by going straight to the RIR
> 			- In this case, it is not uncommon for an end customer to justify a /32 prefix
> 	- The example in the figure uses the common and recommended size of the network with 64 bits used as interface ID

- RFC 4291 specifies the 2000::/3 prefix as the global unicast address space that the IANA may allocate to the RIRs
- A Global Unicast Address (GUA) is an IPv6 address created from the global unicast prefix
	- The structure of global unicast address enables the aggregation of routing prefixes, limiting the number of routing table entries in the global routing table
	- Global unicast addresses that are used on links are aggregated upward through organizations and eventually to the ISPs
- Global unicast addresses are routable and reachable across the internet
- They are intended for widespread generic use
- A global unicast address is structured hierarchically to allow address aggregation
- In the 2000::/3 prefix, /3 prefix length states that only the first 3 bits are significant in matching the prefix 2000
	- The first 3 bits of the first hexadecimal value, 2, are 001
	- The fourth bit is insignificant and can be either 0 or 1
	- Therefore the first hex digit is either 2 (0010) or 3 (0011)
	- The remaining th12 bits in the hextet (16-bit segment) can be 0 or 1
	- This results in a range of global unicast addresses from 2000:: through 3fff:ffff:ffff:ffff:ffff:ffff:ffff:ffff
![[Pasted image 20241110210826.png]]
- A global routing prefix is assigned to a service provider by IANA
	- The first 3 bits plus the following 45 bits identify the organization's site within the public domain
- An individual organization can use a subnet ID to create its own local addressing hierarchy and identify subnets
	- A subnet ID is similar to a subnet in IPv4, except that an organization with an IPv6 subnet ID can support many more individual subnets (the actual number depends on the global routing prefix)
	- An individual organization with a 16-bit IPv6 subnet can support up to 65,535 individual subnets
- The interface ID has the same meaning for all unicast addresses
	- It is used to identify the interfaces on a link and must be unique to the link
- The interface ID is 64 bits long and depending on the device operating system, can be created using the EUI-64 format or by using a randomly generated number
	- An example of a global unicast address is 2001:0db8:bbbb:cccc:0987:65ff:fe01:2345

**IPv6 Link-Local Unicast Address**
- Link-Local Addresses (LLAs) refer only to a particular physical link (physical network)
- The concept of the link-local scope is not new
	- RFC 3927 defined 169.254.x.x block as link-local for IPv4
	- Routers do not forward packets using link-local addresses, not even within the organization
		- They are only for local communication on a particular physical network segment
![[Pasted image 20241119210222.png]]
- A link-local address is an IPv6 unicast address that is automatically configured on any interface
- This address is the first IPv6 address that will be enabled on the interface
- A device does not have to have any other address but must have a link-local address
- A link-local address consists of the link-local prefix fe80::/10 (111 111 110 10) and the interface identifier that can be modified in EUI-74 format or randomly generated value depending on the operating system installed on the networking device
- It is common practice to statically configure link-local addresses on the router interfaces to make troubleshooting easier
	- Nodes on a local link can use link-local addresses to communicate
		- The nodes do not need globally unique addresses to communicate
- Link-local addresses are used for link communications such as automatic address configuration, neighbour discovery and router discovery
- Many IPv6 routing protocols also use link-local addresses
	- For static routing, the address of the next-hop device should be specified using the link-local address of the device
	- For dynamic routing, all IPv6 routing protocols must exchange the link-local addresses of neighbouring devices
- E.g. of a link-local unicast address is fe80:0000:0000:0000:0987:65ff:fe01:2345 or fe80::98765ff:fe01:2345
- The prefix fe80::/10 for link-local addresses includes addresses beginning with fe80-febf
	- In practice, link-local addresses typically begin with fe80

**IPv6 Unique Local Unicast Address**
- Unique local unicast addresses are analogous to private IPv4 addresses in that they are used for local communications, intersite VPNs, and so on
	- Except that these addresses are not intended to be translated to a global unicast address
	- They are not routable on the internet without IPv6 NAT, but they are routable inside a limited area, such as a site
	- They may also be routed between a limited set of sites
- A unique local unicast address has these characteristics:
	- It has a globally unique prefix, it has a high probability of uniqueness
	- It has a well-known prefix to enable easy filtering at site boundaries
	- It allows combining or privately interconnecting sites without creating any address conflicts or requiring a renumbering of interfaces that use these prefixes
	- It is ISP-independent and can be used for communications inside a site without having any permanent or intermittent internet connectivity
	- If it is accidentally leaked outside of a site via routing or the Domain Name System, there is no conflict with any other addresses
	- Applications may treat unique local addresses like globally scoped addresses

![[Pasted image 20241119211226.png]]
- In unique local unicast addresses, global IDs are defined by the administrator of the local domain 
- Subnet IDs are also defined by the administrator of the local domain
- Subnet IDs are typically defined using a hierarchical addressing plan, allowing routes to be summarized and reducing the size of routing updates and routing tables
- E.g. of unique local unicast address is fc00:aaaa:bbbb:cccc:0987:65ff:fe01:2345

**Loopback Addresses**
- Packets that are sent to this address "loopback" to the sending device
- IPv6 there is one address for this function
- The loopback address is 0:0:0:0:0:0:0:1 or ::1

**Unspecified Addresses**
- All zeros address is named the unspecified address
- Typically used in the source field of a packet sent by a device requesting to have its IPv6 address configured
- You can apply address compression to this address
- The address is expressed as ::

**IPv6 Multicast Addresses**
![[Pasted image 20241119212535.png]]
>The figure illustrates the format of an IPv6 multicast address
>	- The first 8 bits are ff, followed by 4 bits allocated for flags and a 4-bit Scope field
>	- The Scope field defines the range to which routers can forward the multicast packet
>	- The next 112 bits represent the group ID
>	- The first 3 flags are beyond CCNA
>	- The fourth flag bit, the least significant bit (LSB) or the last bit, is the transient flag (T flag)
>	- The T flag denotes the 2 types of multicast addresses:
>		- Permanent (0)
>			- These addresses, known as predefined multicast addresses, are assigned by IANA and include both well-known and solicited multicast
>		- Non-permanent (1)
>			- These are transient or dynamically assigned multicast addresses, multicast applications assign them

- The scope bits define the scope of the multicast group
	- A scope value 1 means interface-local scope or node-local scope, which spans only a single interface on a node
		- It is used for loopback transmission of multicast
	- A scope value of 3 means link-local scope
		- It spans the topology area of a single link
	- The admin-local scope is not automatically defined from the physical topology or another non-multicast-related configuration and should be defined by an administrator
		- The admin-local scope is the smallest administratively defined multicast scope
	- A site-local scope spans a single site, organization-local scope spans several sites in one organization

**IPv6 multicast address scopes**

| IPv6 Multicast Address | Description             | Scope            |
| ---------------------- | ----------------------- | ---------------- |
| ff01::1                | All nodes address       | Node-local scope |
| ff01::2                | All routers address     | Node-local scope |
| ff02::1                | All nodes address       | Link-local scope |
| ff02::1:2              | All DHCP servers        | Link-local scope |
| ff02::5                | OSPF routers            | Link-local scope |
| ff02::6                | OSPF designated routers | Link-local scope |
| ff02::9                | RIP routers             | Link-local scope |
| ff02::A                | EIGRP routers           | Link-local scope |
| ff05::2                | All routers address     | Site-local scope |
| ff05::1:3              | All DHCP servers        | Site-local scope |

- An IPv6 multicast address defines a group of devices known as a multicast group
- IPv6 multicast addresses use the prefix ff00::/8, which is IPv4 equivalent 224.0.0.0/4
- A packet sent to a multicast group always has a unicast source address
- A multicast address can never be the source address
- Unlike IPv4, there is no broadcast address in IPv6
	- IPv6 uses multicast, including an all-IPv6 devices well-known multicast address and a solicited-node multicast address
- Although site-local unicast addresses have been deprecated (RFC 3879), the concept of site-local scope still applies to IPv6 multicast addresses

**IPv6 Anycast Addresses**
- An IPv6 anycast address is an address that can be assigned to more than 1 interface, typically on different devices
	- Multiple devices can have the same anycast address
- According to the router's routing table, a packet sent to an anycast address is routed to the "nearest" interface having that address

![[Pasted image 20241119215628.png]]
> Multiple servers (Server A, Server B, Server C and Server D) share the same anycast IPv6 address 2001:7ac::43db
> - Host X wants to send a packet to the destination server with IPv6 address 2001:7ac::43db
> 	- Because there are multiple servers with the same IPv6 address, the packet is sent only to the "nearest" device that has this IPv6 address
> In this example, "nearest" is presented by the "cost" from source to destination 
> 	- The lowest calculated cost value is 8 (Host X to Server C), meaning that the packet arrives at Server C

- Anycast address are available for both IPv4 and IPv6, initially defined in RFC 1546, Host Anycasting Service
	- Anycast was meant to be used for DNS and HTTP services but was never really implemented as designed
- Anycast addresses are syntactically indistinguishable from unicast addresses because anycast addresses are allocated from the unicast address space
	- Assigning a unicast address to more than one interface makes a unicast an anycast address
	- The nodes to which the anycast address is assigned must be explicitly configured to recognize that the address is an anycast address


![[Pasted image 20241119215812.png]]
> Such anycast address has the following format as above
> - Some reserved anycast address formats such as the subnet-router anycast address are defined in RFC 4291 and RFC 2526

- The subnet-router anycast address has a prefix followed by a series of zeros (as the interface ID)
	- E.g. if the prefix for the subnet 2001:db8:10f:1::/64 then the subnet router anycast address for that subnet is 2001:db8:10f:1::
- If you send a packet to the subnet-router anycast address, it will be delivered to one router with an interface in that subnet
- All routers must have subnet-router anycast addresses for the subnets that are configured on their interfaces

**Reserved Addresses**
- The IETF reserved a portion of the IPv6 address space for various uses, both present and future
- Reserved addresses represent 1/256th of the total IPv6 address space
- The lowest address within each subnet prefix (the interface identifier set to all zeroes) is reserved as the subnet-router anycast address
- The 128 highest addresses within each /64 subnet prefix are reserved for use as anycast addresses

### Comparison of IPv4 and IPv6 Headers
![[Pasted image 20241121212042.png]]
> The figure illustrates the IPv4 header format

- The IPv4 header contains 12 fields
	- Following these fields ae an Options field of variable length that the figure shows in yellow and a padding field followed by the data portion, usually the transport layer segment
- The basic IPv4 header has a size of 20 octet
	- The Options field increases the size of the IPv4 header
- Of the 12 Ipv4 header fields, 6 are removed in IPv6, shown in green
- The main reasons for removing these fields in IPv6 are:
	- The Internet Header Length Field (shown as HD Len) was removed because it is no longer required
		- Unlike the variable-length IPv4 header, the IPv6 header is fixed at 40 octets
	- Fragmentation is processed differently in IPv6 and does not need the related fields in the basic IPv4 header
		- In IPv6 , routers no longer process fragmentation
			- IPv6 hosts are responsible for path Maximum Transmission Unit (MTU) discovery
			- If the host needs to send data that exceeds the MTU, the host is responsible for fragmentation (this process is recommended but not required)
			- The related Flags field option appears in the Fragmentation Extension Header in IPv6
			- This header is attached only to a packet that is fragmented
	- The Header Checksum field at the IP layer was removed because most data link layer technologies already perform checksum and error control
		- This change forces formerly optional upper-layer checksums (such as UDP) to become mandatory
- The Options field is not present in IPv6
	- In IPv6, a chain of extension headers processes any additional services
		- Examples of extension headers include Fragmentation, Authentication Header and Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP)
	- Most other fields were either unchanged or changed only slightly

![[Pasted image 20241121212052.png]]
> The figure illustrates the IPv6 header format
> 	- The IPv6 header has 40 octets instead of 20 octets in IPv4
> 	- The IPv6 header has fewer fields and the header is aligned on 64-bit boundaries to enable fast processing by current and next-generation processors
> 	- The Source and destination address fields are 4 times larger than in IPv4

- The IPv6 header contains 8 fields
	- Version
		- This 4-bit field contains the number 6, instead of the number 4 as in IPv4
	- Traffic Class
		- This 8-bit field is similar to the Type of Service (ToS) field in IPv4
		- The source node uses this field to mark the priority of outbound packets
	- Flow Label
		- This new field has a length of 20 bits and is used to mark individual traffic flows with unique values
		- Routers are expected to apply an identical Quality of Service (QoS) treatment to each packet in a flow
	- Payload Length
		- This field is like the Total Length field for IPv4 but because the IPv6 base header is a fixed size, this field describes the length of the payload only, not of the entire packet
	- Next Header
		- The value of this field determines the type of information that follows the basic IPv6 header
	- Hop Limit
		- This field specifies the maximum number of hops that an IPv6 packet can take
		- The initial hop limit value is set by an operating system (64 or 128 is common but up to the operating system)
		- Each IPv6 router decrements the hop limit field along the path to the destination
		- An IPv6 packet is dropped when the hop limit field reaches 0
		- The hop limit is designed to prevent packets from dropped circulating forever if there is a routing error
			- In normal routing, this limit should never be reached
	- Source Address
		- This field of 16 octets or 128 bits identifies the source of the packet
	- Destination Address
		- This field of 16 octets or 128 bits identifies the destination of the packet
- The extension headers, if there are any, follow these 8 fields
	- The number of extension headers is not fixed, so the total length of the extension header chain is variable
- RFC 8200, Internet Protocol, Version 6 (IPv6) Specification explores further

#### Connecting IPv6 and IPv4 Networks
- Devices running different protocols, IPv4 and IPv6 cannot communicate unless some translation mechanism is implemented
- 3 main options are available for transitioning to IPv6 from the existing IPv4 network infrastructure:
	- Dual stack network
		- IPv4 and IPv6 are fully deployed across the infrastructure, so configuration and routing protocols handle IPv4 and IPv6 addressing and adjacencies separately
	- Tunneling
		- Organizations build an overlay network that tunnels one protocol over the other by encapsulating the IPv6 packets within the IPv4 packets over the IPv4 network and IPv4 packets within IPv6 packets IPv6 network
	- Translation
		- Facilitates communication between IPv6-only and IPv4-only hosts and networks by performing IP header and address translation between the 2 address families

### Internet Control Message Protocol Version 6
- Internet Control Message Protocol Version 6 (ICMPv6) provides the same diagnostic services as Internet Control Protocol Version 4 (ICMPv4) and it extends the functionality for some specific IPv6 functions that did not exist in IPv4

![[Pasted image 20241123171450.png]]
- ICMPv6 enables nodes to perform diagnostic tests and report problems
- Like ICMPv4, ICMPv6 implements 2 kinds of messages
	- Error messages (such as Destination Unreachable, Packet Too Big or Time Exceeded)
	- Informational messages (such as Echo Request and Echo Reply)

#### ICMPv6 Type Field Descriptions

| ICMPv6 Type Field | Description             |
| ----------------- | ----------------------- |
| 1                 | Destination Unreachable |
| 128               | Echo Request            |
| 129               | Echo Reply              |
| 133               | Router Solicitation     |
| 134               | Router Advertisement    |
| 135               | Neighbour Solicitation  |
| 136               | Neighbour Advertisement |
- The ICMPv6 packet is identified as 58 in the Next Header Field
- Inside the ICMPv6 packet, the Type field identifies the type of ICMP message
- The Code field further details the specifics of this type of message
- The Data field contains information that is sent to the receiver for diagnostics or information purpose
- ICMPv6 is used on-link for router solicitation and advertisement and for the redirection of nodes to the best gateway
- Neighbour solicitation messages are sent on the local link when a node wants to determine the data link layer address of another node on the same local link
	- After receiving the neighbour solicitation message, the destination node replies by sending a neighbour advertisement message
	- This message includes the data link layer address of the node sending the neighbour advertisement message
	- Hosts send router Solicitation messages to locate the routers on the local link and routers respond with router advertisements that enable autoconfiguration of the hosts

### Neighbour Discovery
- Neighbour discovery uses ICMPv6 neighbour solicitation and neighbour advertisement messages

![[Pasted image 20241123173125.png]]
> The figure depicts the neighbour discovery process, where host A wants to communicate with host B using IPv6
> 	- Since it does not know the data link layer address (MAC address) of host B, it sends a neighbour solicitation message and host B replies with a neighbour advertisement message

- Neighbour discovery is a process that enables these functions:
	- Determining the data link layer address of a neighbour on the same link, like Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) in IPv4
	- Finding neighbour routers on a link
	- Keeping track of neighbours
	- Querying for duplicate addresses
- The neighbour discovery process uses solicited-node multicast addresses

#### Solicited-Node Multicast Address
- The solicited-node address is a multicast address that has a link-local scope
- All nodes must join the solicited-node multicast group that corresponds to each of its unicast and anycast address
- The solicited-node address is composed of the ff02:0:0:0:0:1:ff00::/104 prefix, which is concatenated with the far right 24 bits of the corresponding unicast or anycast address

![[Pasted image 20241123184437.png]]
> The source node creates a solicited-node multicast address using the right-most 24 bits of the IPv6 address of the destination node and sends a Neighbour Solicitation message to this multicast address
> 	- The corresponding node responds with its data link layer address in a Neighbour Advertisement message

#### Multicast Mapping over Ethernet
- A packer destined to a solicited-node multicast address is put in a frame destined to an associated MAC address
- If an IPv6 address is known, then the associated IPv6 solicited-node multicast address is known

![[Pasted image 20241123184840.png]]
> The example gives the IPv6 address 2001:db8:1001:f:2c0:10ff:fe17:fc0f
> 	- The associated solicited-node multicast address is ff02::1:ff17:fc0f
> 	- If an IPv6 solicited-node multicast address is known, then the associated MAC address is known, formed by concatenating the last 32 bits of the IPv6 solicited-node multicast address to 33:33
> 	- As the figure shows, the IPv6 solicited-node multicast address is ff02::1:ff17:fc0f
> 		- The associated Ethernet MAC address is 33-33-ff-17-fc-0f

- Understand that the resulting MAC address is a virtual MAC address
	- It is not burned into any Ethernet card
- Depending on the IPv6 unicast address, which determines the IPv6 solicited-node multicast address, an Ethernet card may be instructed to listen to any of the 2<sup>24</sup> possible virtual MAC addresses that begin with 33-33-ff
	- In IPv6, Ethernet cards often listen to multiple virtual multicast MAC addresses and their own burned-in unicast MAC addresses
- A solicited-node multicast is more efficient than an Ethernet broadcast used by IPv4 ARP
	- With ARP, all nodes receive and must therefore process the broadcast requests
	- By using IPv6 solicited-node multicast addresses, fewer devices receive the request
	- Therefore fewer frames need to be passed to an upper layer to determine whether they are intended for that specific host

![[Pasted image 20241123205945.png]]
> PC1 sends a Neighbour Solicitation to PC4
> 	- The IPv6 packet has the source IPv6 address of PC1 and the PC4 Solicited Node as the destination IPv6 address
> 	- The Layer 2 frame has the source MAC address of PC1 and the PC4 Solicited-Node Multicast MAC address as the destination
> 	- SW1 forwards this frame as an unknown unicast frame
> 		- This is a multicast frame, the solicited node MAC address is not used as the source MAC address, so the switch does not learn the MAC address associated to its interfaces
> 	- This frame reaches all the IPv6 nodes in the broadcast domain
> 	- PC2 drops the frame before opening it because PC2 is not the LAyer 2 destination of this frame
> 	- PC3 and PC4 have the same solicited node addresses (Layer 3 and Layer 2) because of the last 24 bits of the Global Unicast IPv6 address are the same
> 		- Because both devices have the same Layer 2 destination address, they both open the Layer 2 frame
> 			- The same happens at Layer 3
> 		- They both open the packet because the Layer 3 destination of the ICMPv6 packets is the same address
> 	- PC3 drops the frame after looking at the content of the packet
> 		- Because PC4 is the real destination of Neighbour Solicitation, it replies with a Neighbour Advertisement

- By using the IPv4 ARP process, the PC2 would open the ARP request, because the ARP request MAC Address destination is a broadcast address, to determine that the ARP request was not for it
- From a Layer 2 perspective, PC2 was a destination of the message as well
	- This is why using the Neighbour Discovery Protocol (NDP) multicast and solicited node addresses is more efficient than using the broadcast as the ARP process does
### IPv6 Address Allocation


#### Router Advertisements


#### Router Solicitation 


#### Configuring Stateless Autoconfiguration
- The "ipv6 address autoconfig" command enables stateless autoconfiguration on routers on an interface-by-interface basis

```
ipv6 address autoconfig [default]
```
![[Pasted image 20241123213832.png]]

| Command                           | Description                                                                                                                      |
| --------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| ipv6 address autoconfig [default] | Configures stateless autoconfiguration on the interface. If you add the default keyword, the router will install a default route |
- A typical scenario to configure the "ipv6 address autoconfig default" command on a router interface is when it is connected directly to an ISP and getting a dynamic address
- The ISP provides the prefis using autoconfigure
- The IPv6 address and the Default Gateway can be used to configure a default route by using the NDP message that the ISP sends
