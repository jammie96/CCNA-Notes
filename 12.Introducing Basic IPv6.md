### IPv4 Address Exhaustion Workarounds
- IPv4 provides approximately 4 billion unique addresses 
	- Still not enough to keep up with the growth of the internet
- To extend the lifetime and usefulness of IPv4 and to circumvent the address shortage, several mechanisms were created:
	- Classless interdomain routing (CIDR)
	- Variable-length subnet masking (VLSM)
	- Network Address Translation (NAT)
	- Private IPv4 addresses space (RFC 1918)
- Over the years, hardware support has been added to devices to support IPv4 enhancements through Application Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs)
	- This offloads processing from the equipment CPU to network hardware
		- Allows more simultaneous transmission and higher bandwidth utilization

**CIDR** #CIDR
- CIDR allows the address space to be divided into smaller blocks, varying in size depending on the number of hosts needed in individual blocks
	- These blocks are no longer associated with predefined IPv4 addresses classes, such as class A, B and C
	- Instead, the allocation includes a subnet mask or prefix length, which defines the size of the block

**VLSM** #VLSM
- VLSM allows more efficient use of IPv4 addresses, specifically on small segments, such as point-to-point serial links
- VLSM usage was recommended in RFC 1817
- CIDR and VLSM support was a prerequisite for ISPs to improve the scalability of the routing on the internet

**NAT** #NAT
- Introduced a model in which a device facing outward to the internet has a globally routable IPv4 address, while the internal network is configured with private RFC 1918 addresses
	- These private addresses can never be routed outside the site, as they can be identified in many different enterprise networks
- In this way, even large enterprises with thousands of systems can hide behind a few routable public networks
- One of the arguments against deploying IPv6 is that NAT will solve the problems of limited address space in IPv4 #IPv6 
- NAT merely delays the exhaustion of the IPv4 address space
	- Many large organizations and ISPs are moving to IPv6 because they are running out of IPv4 private addresses, e.g. Internet of Things (IoT) devices are added to their networks
- Negative implications of using NAT, some of which are identified in RFC 2775 and RFC2993:
	- NAT breaks the end-to-end model of IP, in which only the endpoints, not the intermediary devices, should process the packets
	- NAT inhibits end-to-end network security
		- To protect the integrity of the IP header by some cryptographic functions, the IP header cannot be changed between the origin of the packet (to protect the integrity of the header) and the final destination (to check the integrity of the received packet)
		- Any translation of parts of a header on the path will break the integrity check
	- When applications are not NAT-friendly, NAT must be embed complete knowledge of the applications to perform correctly
		- For a specific application, more than just the port and address mapping are necessary to forward the packet through the NAT device
			- This is true for dynamically allocated ports, embedded IP addresses in application protocols, security associations and so on
		- Therefore, NAT device needs to be upgraded each time a new non-NAT-friendly application is deployed, e.g. peer-to-peer
	- When different networks use the same private address space and merge or connect, an address space collision occurs
		- Hosts that are different but have the same address cannot communicate with each other
		- There are NAT techniques available to help with this issue but they increase NAT complications

**DHCP** #DHCP
- Used extensively in IPv4 networks to dynamically allocate addresses, typically from private IPv4 addresses space (RFC 1918), then translated to public addresses using NAT

### Ipv6 Features
- Although VLSM, NAT and other workarounds (for avoiding the transition to IPv6) are available, networks with internet connectivity must begin the transition to IPv6 as soon as possible
- For IPv4 networks that provide goods and services to internet users, it is especially important because the transition by the internet community is already underway
- New networks may be unable to acquire IPv4 addresses and networks running IPv6 exclusively will not be able to communicate with IPv4-only networks unless you configure an intermediary gateway or another transition mechanism
- IPv4 and IPv6 are completely separate protocols and IPv6 is not backward compatible with IPv4
- As the internet evolves, organizations must adopt IPv6 to support future business continuity, growth and global expansion
- Furthermore, some ISPs and Regional Internet Registries (RIRs) are administratively out of IPv4 addresses, meaning that their supply of IPv4 addresses is now limited and organizations have to migrate to and support IPv6 networks

- IPv6 includes several features that make it attractive for building global-scale, highly effective networks:
	- Larger address space
		- Provides improved global reachability and flexibility
		- A better aggregation of IP prefixes is announced in the routing tables
		- The aggregation of routing prefixes limits the number of routing table entries, creating efficient and scalable routing tables
		- Multihoming increases the reliability of the internet connection of an IP network
			- With IPv6, a host can have multiple IP addresses over one physical upstream link
				- E.g. a host can connect to several ISPs
		- Autoconfiguration is available
		- There are more plug-and-play options for more devices
		- Simplified mechanisms are available for address renumbering and modification
	- Simpler header
		- Streamlined fixed header structures make the processing of IPv6 packets faster and more efficient for intermediate routers within the network
			- This is true when large number of packets are routed in the core of the IPv6 internet
	- Security and mobility
		- Features that were not part of the original IPv4 specification are now built into IPv6
			- IP Security (IPsec) is available in IPv6, allowing the IPv6 networks to be secure #IPsec
			- Mobility enables mobile network devices to move around in networks without breaks in established network connections
	- Transition richness
		- Includes a rich set of tools to aid in transitioning networks in IPv4, to allow an easy, non-disruptive transition over time to IPv6-dominant networks
			- E.g. dual stacking, in which devices run both IPv4 and IPv6

### IPv6 Addresses and Address Types
- IPv6 addresses consist of 128 bits and are represented as a series of 8 16-bit hexadecimal fields separated by colons
- Although the upper and lowercase is permitted, it is best practice to use lowercase for IPv6 representation
- Address representation:
	- Format is x:x:x:x:X:X:X:X, where x is a 16-bit hexadecimal field
		- E.g. 2001:0db8:010f:0001:0000:0000:0000:00acd
	- Leading zeroes in a field can be omitted
		- E.g. 2001:db8:10f:1:0:0:0:acd
	- Successive fields of 0 are represented as "::" but only once in an address
		- E.g. 2001:db8:10f:1::acd
		- An address parser can identify the number of missing zeroes by separating the 2 parts and filling in zeroes until the 128 bits are completed
			- However if 2 double colons are places, there is no way to identify the size of each block of zeroes
		- The double colons makes many addresses very small
			- E.g. ff01:0:0:0:0:0:0:1 becomes ff01::1
		- All zeroes address is written as a double colon, this type of address representation is known as the unspecified address
	- The a,b,c,d,e,f in hexadecimal fields can either be uppercase or lowercase but it is best to use lowercase for IPv6 representation
		- Although Cisco IOS accepts both lowercase and uppercase, RFC 5952 recommends to represent in lowercase to ensure compatibility with case-sensitive applications

#### IPv6 Address Types
![[Pasted image 20241110163933.png]]

- IPv6 supports 3 basic types of addresses
- Each address type has specific rules regarding its construction and us
	- Unicast
		- Used in a one-to-one context
	- Multicast 
		- Identifies a group of interfaces
		- Traffic that is sent to a multicast address is sent to multiple destinations at the same time
		- An interface may belong to any number of multicast groups
	- Anycast
		- An IPv6 anycast address is assigned to an interface on more than one node
		- When a packet is sent to an anycast address, it is routed to the nearest interface that has this address
			- The nearest interface is found according to the measure of metric of the particular routing protocol #Metric 
		- All nodes that share the same address should behave the same way so that the service is offered similarly, regardless of the node that services the request
- IPv6 does not support broadcast addresses in the way that they are used in IPv4
	- Instead, specific multicast addresses (such as the all-nodes multicast address) are used
- IPv6 unicast addresses are assigned to each node (interface)
	- Their uses are discussed in RFC 4291:

| Address        | Value     | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| -------------- | --------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Global Unicast | 2000::/3  | Assigned by IANA and used on public networks. They are equivalent to IPv4 global (public) addresses. ISPs summarize these to provide scalability on the internet                                                                         |
| Link-local     | fe80::/10 | An automatically configured IPv6 address on an interface, the scope is only on the physical link and is required                                                                                                                         |
| Unique-local   | fc00::/7  | Unique local unicast addresses are analogous to private IPv4 addresses in that they are used for local communications. The scope is the entire site or organization                                                                      |
| Loopback       | ::1       | Link the 127.0.0.1 address in IPv4, ::1 is used for local testing functions. Unlike IPv4, which dedicates a complete class A block of addresses for local testing, IPv6 uses only 1                                                      |
| Unspecified    | ::        | 0.0.0.0 in IPv4 means "unknown" address. In IPv6, this address is represented by :: and is typically used in the source address field of the packet when an interface does not have and address and is trying to acquire one dynamically |

- An IPv6 address prefix, in the format ipv6-prefix/prefix-length, can be used to represent bitwise contiguous blocks of the entire address space
- The prefix length is a decimal value that indicates how many of the high-order contiguous bits of the address compose the prefix
- An IPv6 address network prefix is represented in the same way as the network prefix ( e.g. 10.1.1.0/24 in IPv4)
	- E.g. 2001:db8:8086:6502::/32 is a valid IPv6 prefix
#### IPv6 Address Scopes and Prefixes
- An IPv6 address scope specifies the region of the network in which the address is valid
	- E.g. the link-local address has a scope that is called "link-local", which means that it is valid and should be used on a directly attached network (link)
- Scopes can apply to both unicast and multicast addresses
- There are several different scopes or regions
	- Link scope
	- Organization scope
	- Global network scope

![[Pasted image 20241110193940.png]]

- Addresses in the link scope are called link-local addresses and routers will not forward to these addresses to other links or networks
- Addresses intended to span multiple sites belonging to one organization are called organization-local addresses
	- Addresses in the global network scope are called global unicast addresses
- The IPv6 site-local unicast addresses are deprecated in the RFC 3879

**Multiple IPv6 Addresses on an Interface**
- As with IPv4, IPv6 addresses are assigned to interfaces
	- However, IPv6 interface is expected to have multiple addresses
- The IPv6 addresses that are assigned to an interface can be any of the basic types; unicast, multicast or anycast

**IPv6 Unicast Addresses**
- An IPv6 unicast address generally uses 64 bits for the network ID and 64 bits for the interface ID
- The network ID is administratively assigned and the interface ID can be configured manually or autoconfigured
- When you use Stateless Address AutoConfiguration (SLAAC) IPv6 address assignment method, a 64-bit interface ID is required

**Use or EUI-64 Format Interface ID in IPv6 Addresses**
- The Interface ID in an IPv6 address is analogous to the host portion of an IPv4 address
	- It uniquely identifies an interface on a link
- A 64-bit interface ID is not required but is highly recommended
- However, a 64-bit interface ID is required when an IPv6 address is autoconfigured
- One way to guarantee that the interface ID is unique is to base it on the MAC address of the interface
- The Extended Universal Identifier 64-bit format (EUI-64) defines the method to create an interface identifier from an IEEE 48-bit MAC address
- Sine the EUI-64 format is based on a unique MAC address, using this format, a device can automatically assign itself a unique 64-bit IPv6 interface ID without the need for manual configuration or DHCP
![[Pasted image 20241110194726.png]]
> The EUI-74 format interface ID is derived from the 48-bit MAC address by inserting the hexadecimal number ffe between the upper 3 bytes (OUI field) and the lower 3 vendor assigned bytes of the MAC address
> 	- Then, the seventh but from the left of the first octet, or the universal/local (U/L) bit, is inverted
> 		- This bit defines whether this interface identifier is universally or locally administered
> 	- If after inverting the seventh bit is 0, the address is locally administered and if it's 1, the address is globally unique
> 		- It is worth nothing that in the OUI portion, the globally unique addresses assigned by the IEEE have always been set to 0 whereas the locally created addresses have 1 configured
> 		- Therefore, when the bit is inverted, it maintains its original scope (global unique address is still global unique and vice versa)

**IPv6 Global Unicast Address**
- Both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses are generally assigned in a hierarchical manner
- ISPs assign users IP addresses
- ISPs obtain allocations of IP addresses from a Local Internet Registry (LIR) or National Internet Registry (NIR) or their appropriate RIR
- The RIR, in turn, obtains IP addresses from the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN), the operator for IANA

![[Pasted image 20241110200122.png]]
> The figure shows how address space can be allocated to the RIR and ISP
> 	- These values are minimum allocations, which means that an RIR will get a /23 or shorter, and ISP will get a /32 or shorter and a site will get a /48 or shorter
> 		- A shorter prefix length allows more available address space
> 			- E.g. a site could get a /40 or /48, giving it more addresses to justify to its ISP
> 		- The end customer can also choose a provider-independent address space by going straight to the RIR
> 			- In this case, it is not uncommon for an end customer to justify a /32 prefix
> 	- The example in the figure uses the common and recommended size of the network with 64 bits used as interface ID

- RFC 4291 specifies the 2000::/3 prefix as the global unicast address space that the IANA may allocate to the RIRs
- A Global Unicast Address (GUA) is an IPv6 address created from the global unicast prefix
	- The structure of global unicast address enables the aggregation of routing prefixes, limiting the number of routing table entries in the global routing table
	- Global unicast addresses that are used on links are aggregated upward through organizations and eventually to the ISPs
- Global unicast addresses are routable and reachable across the internet
- They are intended for widespread generic use
- A global unicast address is structured hierarchically to allow address aggregation
- In the 2000::/3 prefix, /3 prefix length states that only the first 3 bits are significant in matching the prefix 2000
	- The first 3 bits of the first hexadecimal value, 2, are 001
	- The fourth bit is insignificant and can be either 0 or 1
	- Therefore the first hex digit is either 2 (0010) or 3 (0011)
	- The remaining th12 bits in the hextet (16-bit segment) can be 0 or 1
	- This results in a range of global unicast addresses from 2000:: through 3fff:ffff:ffff:ffff:ffff:ffff:ffff:ffff
![[Pasted image 20241110210826.png]]
- A global routing prefix is assigned to a service provider by IANA
	- The first 3 bits plus the following 45 bits identify the organization's site within the public domain
- An individual organization can use a subnet ID to create its own local addressing hierarchy and identify subnets
	- A subnet ID is similar to a subnet in IPv4, except that an organization with an IPv6 subnet ID can support many more individual subnets (the actual number depends on the global routing prefix)
	- An individual organization with a 16-bit IPv6 subnet can support up to 65,535 individual subnets
- The interface ID has the same meaning for all unicast addresses
	- It is used to identify the interfaces on a link and must be unique to the link
- The interface ID is 64 bits long and depending on the device operating system, can be created using the EUI-64 format or by using a randomly generated number
	- An example of a global unicast address is 2001:0db8:bbbb:cccc:0987:65ff:fe01:2345
