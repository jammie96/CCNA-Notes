- LAN is a network of endpoints and other components that are located relatively close together in a limited area #LAN
- LANs can vary widely in size
	- May consist of only 2 computers in a home office or small business, or it may include hundreds of computers in a large corporate office or multiple buildings
	- Organizations or individuals typically build and own the whole infrastructure, all the way down to the physical cabling
- Defining characteristics of LANs, in contrast to WANs, include their typically higher data transfer rates, smaller geographic area and the lack of need for leased telecommunication lines
- WAN is a data communications network that provides access to other networks over a large geographical area #WAN 
	- WANs use facilitates that an ISP or carriers, such as telephone or cable company, provides
	- The provider connects locations of an organization to each other, to locations of other organizations, to external services and remote users
	- WANs carry various traffic types such as voice, data and video
##### Functions of LAN
###### Data and applications
- When users are connected through a network, they can share files and even software applications
- This capability makes data more easily available and promotes more efficient collaboration on work projects

###### Resources
- The resources that can be shared include input devices, such as cameras and output devices, such as printers

###### Communication path to other networks
- If a resource is not available locally, the LAN can provide connectivity via a gateway to remote resources, such as the Internet
#### LAN Components #LAN

##### Hosts
- Include any device that can send or receive data on the LAN
- Sometimes called endpoints
##### Interconnections
- Allows data to travel from one point to another in the network
- Include: Network Interface Cards (NICs) & Network Media
###### Network Interface Cards (NICs)
- Translate the data that is produced by the device into a frame format that can be transmitted over the LAN
- Connect a device to the LAN over copper cable, fiber-optic cable or wireless communication
###### Network Media 
- Traditional LANs = Data was primarily transmitted over copper and fiber-optic cables
- Moden LANs = Include wireless LAN (WLAN)

##### Network Devices
- Responsible for data delivery between hosts
###### Ethernet Switches #Switch
- Forms the aggregation point of LANs
- Ethernet switches operate at Layer 2 of the Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) model and provide intelligent distribution of frames within the LAN
###### Routers #Routers 
- Sometimes called gateways, provide means to connect LAN segments and provide connectivity to the Internet
- Routers operate at Layer 3 of the OSI model
###### Access Points (APs) #AccessPointsAP 
- Provide wireless connectivity to LAN devices
- Operate at Layer 2 of the OSI model

##### Protocols
- Rules that govern how data is transmitted between components of a network
- Commonly used in LAN protocols:
	- Ethernet protocols (IEEE 802.2 and IEEE 802.3)
	- IP
	- TCP
	- UDP
	- Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) for IPv4 and Neighbor Discovery Protocol (NDP) for IPv6
	- Common Internet File System (CIFs)
	- DHCP

#### Need for Switches #Switch 
- Switches were introduced to LANs to divide a network into segments
![[Pasted image 20240930173554.png]]
> Segment is a network connection that is made by a single unbroken network cable

- When network devices had few network segments, endpoints shared the same media
	- Before switches, end devices were connected by hub #hub
	- Hub is a Layer 1 device that acts as a simple electric repeater that puts all the devices that are connected to it on the same media
	- Network segments that share the same media are known as collision domains as frames may collide with each other
![[Pasted image 20240930174220.png]]
- A network collision occurs when 2 or more devices connected by a shared medium try to communicate at the same time #NetworkCollision
	- In a collision domain, only 1 device was able to transmit at the time, while the other devices had to wait before transmitting to avoid collisions
- The total bandwidth was shared across all host devices on shared media
- Collision also decrease network efficiency

##### Causes of network congestion

###### Increasingly powerful computer and network technologies
- CPUs, buses and peripherals are consistently becoming faster and more powerful, therefore they can send more data at higher rates through the network
###### Increasing volume of network traffic
- Network traffic is now more common, as remote resources are used and are even necessary to carry out basic work
###### High-bandwidth applications
- Software applications are becoming richer in their functionality and are requiring more bandwidth to process
- Applications such as desktop publishing, engineering design, VoD, e-learning and streaming video all require considerable processing power and speed
- This puts a large burden on networks to manage the transmission of their files and requires sharing of the applications among users


#### Characteristics and Features of Switches #Switch 

![[Pasted image 20240930174929.png]]
> - Each switch port represents a segment
> - By default, a switch and all interconnected switches belong to a single LAN

##### Functions of Switches
- Main purpose of switch is to forward frames as fast and efficiently as possible
- Operate at the link layer of the TCP/IP protocol suite
- Selectively forward individual frames
- Have many ports to segment a large LAN into many smaller segments
- Have high speed and support various port speeds

##### Benefits of Switches

###### Dedicated communication between devices
- This increases frame throughput
- Switches with on euser device per port have microsegmented the network
	- In this configuration, each user receives access to the full bandwidth and does not have to contend with other users for available bandwidth
 	- As a result, collisions do not occur
    
###### Multiple simultaneous conversations
- Can occur by forwarding or switching several packets at the same time, increasing network capacity by the number of conversations that are supported
	- E.g. when frames are being forwarded between ports 1 and 2, another conversation can be happening between ports 5 and 6
 	- This is possible because of input/output (I/O) buffers and fast internal transfer speeds between ports
  - A switch that can support all possible combination of frame transfers between all ports simultaneously offer wire-speed and non-blocking performance
  	- Can be expensive
   
###### Full-duplex communication
- After a connection is microsegmented, it has only 2 devices (the switch and the host)
- It is now possible to configure the ports so they can both receive and send data at the same time (full duplex communication) #fullduplex
- E.g. point-to-point 100-Mbps connections have 100Mbps of transmission capacity and 100 Mbps of receiving capacity for an effective 200-Mbps capacity on a single connection
- The configuration between half duplex and full duplex is automatically negotiated at the initial establishment of the link connection
- Half duplex means that there is a transmission of data in just one direction at a time

###### Media-rate adaptation
- A LAN switch with ports supporting various media rates can adapt between different speeds, such as 10, 100 and 1000Mbps; 1 and 10Gbps; 1, 10 and 25 Gbps; 40 and 100Gbps
- This allows bandwitdh to be matched as needed

##### Important characteristics of switches

###### High port density
- Switches have high port densities: 24-, 32- and 48-port switched operate at speeds of 100Mbps, 1Gbps, 10Gbps, 25Gbps, 40Gbps and 100Gbps
- Large enterprise switches may support hundreds of ports
  
###### Large frame buffers
- The ability to store more received frames before having to start dropping them is useful, particularly when there may be congested ports connected to servers or other heavily used parts of the network
  
###### Port speed
- Depending on the switch, port speed may be possible to support a range of bandwidth
- Ports of 100Mbps, 1Gbps and 10Gbps are expected, but 40- or 100- Gbps ports allow even more flexibility
  
###### Fast Internal switching
- Having fast internal switching allows higher bandwidthsL 100Mbps, 1Gbps, 10Gbps, 25Gbps, 40Gbps and 100Gbps
  
###### Low per-port cost
- Switched provide high port density at a lower cost
- LAN switches can accomodate network designs that feature fewer users per segment
	- This feature increases the average available bandwidth per user
