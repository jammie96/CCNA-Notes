### Role of a Router #Routers 
- Routers belong to a series but within the series, different models can be found characterized by different hardware profiles
- Cisco routers can be categorized in:
	- Branch Routers
	- Service Provider Routers
	- Virtual Routers
	- Small Business Routers

#### Branch Routers
- All branch routers are designed to offer a wide range of network and security services and also be usable in the software-defined WAN environment
- Branch Router generally use the IOS XE operating system
- E.g. of branch routers: Cisco Catalyst 8000 Series, Cisco 1000 Series Integrated Services Routers and Cisco 4000 Series Integrated Services Routers
- Cisco Catalyst 8000 Series Edge Platforms with Cisco IOS SD-WAN Software deliver Cisco's secure, cloud-scale SD-WAN solution for the branch
- Catalyst 8300 Series is purpose-built for high-performance and integrated SD-WAN Services along with the flexibility to deliver security and networking services together from the cloud or on-premises
- The Catalyst 8000 Series Edge Platforms have a wide variety of interface options to choose from
	- Ranging from lower and higher module density with backward compatibility to a variety of existing WAN, LAN and voice and compute modules
- Cisco 1000 Series ISRs are a small-form-factor platform that is best suited for small and midsize businesses, enterprise branches and as customer premises equipment in managed services environments
- The ISR 4000 Series consolidates many must-have IT functions, including network, security, compute, storage and unified communications
	- It integrates the Cisco UCS E-Series server along with connectivity options and 4G and readiness for 5G being everything needed in a branch in a single platform
#### Service Provider Routers
- Serves billions of devices with low-latency services and high bandwidth demand, scales with bandwidth demand
- Most of the Service Providers routers work on an IOS XR operating System, which is an operating system built by Cisco that is designed for high scalability and stability
	- Among this router category, we can find ASR and NCS series routers
- Cisco NCS 5500 Network Convergence System Series Routers are designed for mass scale Metro and WAN Aggregation
	- They come in multiple form factors depending on requirements, typically leveraging modular design to allow for efficient expansion and scaling when required
	- These routers support ports with up to 400GbE port density
- The ASR 9000 Series is an edge routing device capable of supporting the application performance required to power 5G service needs
- They are characterized by the top of the industry throughput and reliability, representing the state of the art for edge and core routing

### Virtual Routers
- Virtual routers are used for public, private or provider-hosted clouds
- Examples of Cisco Virtual Routers:
	- Catalyst 8000V Edge
	- Cloud Services Router 1000V
	- IOS XRv 9000
- Cisco CSR extends enterprise networks to public and private clouds
	- Offers routing, security and network management as cloud services with multi-tenancy
	- The series is infrastructure-agnostic and programmable across the LAN and WAN and in the cloud
- The Catalyst 8000V is a virtual-form factor router that delivers SD-WAN, WAN gateway and network services functions into virtual and cloud environments
	- This virtual router is a key element for enterprise network virtualization
		- Can be positioned in external data centers, provider-hosted clouds or internal company data centers

### Small Business Routers
- Includes several types of equipment including Cisco Meraki MX, Cisco 900 Series Integrated Services Routers and Cisco Small Business RV Series Routers
- The Cisco 900 Series ISRs combine internet access, comprehensive security and wireless services in a single high-performance device that is easy to deploy and manage
	- They are well suited for deployment at premises in enterprise small branch offices
	- Those routers are based on a Cisco IOS operating system
- The Cisco Meraki MX is 100% cloud-managed so installation and remote management are zero-touch, making it ideal for distributed branches
	- Provides multifunctional security and SD-WAN enterprise appliances with a wide set of capabilities to address multiple use cases
	- Organizations of all sizes and across all industries rely on the MX to deliver secure connectivity to hub locations or multi-cloud environments
- Cisco Small Business RV Series Routers are primarily bought for remote workers offering Virtual Private Networking (VPN) technology, connecting them to an Enterprise network through a secure internet pathway
	- Those routers are primarily managed and configured by using GUI

### Router Components #Routers
- Cisco offers many different routers which are suited for different networking environments such as enterprise LANs, service provider WANs
	- The various models offer various features that are suitable for an array of different environments
	- However, the core function of a router is to route packets, therefore all routers have many common components #Routers 
- These components are as follows:
	- CPU
		- Is the chip installed on the motherboard that carries out the instructions of a computer program
		- E.g. it processes all the information gathered from other routers or sent to other routers
	- Motherboard
		- The motherboard is the central circuit board, which holds critical electronic components of the system
		- The motherboard provides connections to other peripherals and interfaces
	- Memory:
		- There are 4 primary types of memory
			- RAM
				- Stores data during CPU processing
				- Volatile memory in that its information is lost when power is switched off
				- RAM provides temporary memory for the router's running configuration while the router is powered on
			- NVRAM
				- Retains content when the router is powered down
				- NVRAM stores the startup configuration file for most router platforms
				- It also contains the software configuration register, which determines while Cisco IOS image is used when booting the router
			- ROM
				- Is a Read-Only Memory on the motherboard
				- The content of ROM is not lost when power is switched off
				- Data stored in ROM cannot be modified or it can be modified slowly or with difficulty
				- ROM sometimes contains a ROM monitor (ROMMON)
					- ROM Monitor intializes the hardware and boots the Cisco IOS Software when you power on or reload a router
					- You can use the ROM monitor to perform certain configuration tasks, such as recovering a lost password or downloading software over the console port
				- ROM also includes bootloader software (bootstrap), which helps the router boot when it cannot find a valid Cisco IOS image in the flash memory
				- During normal startup, the ROM Monitor initializes the router and then control passes to the Cisco IOS Software
		- Ports (also known as interfaces)
			- Ports are used to connect to other devices in the network
			- Routers can have these types of ports:
				- Management ports
					- Routers have a console port that can be used to attach to a terminal used for management, configuration and control
					- High-end routers may also have a dedicated Ethernet port that can be used only for management
					- An IP address can be assigned to the Ethernet port and the router can be accessed from a management subnet
					- The auxiliary (AUX) interface on a router is used for remote management of the router
					- Typically, a modem is connected to the AUX interface for dial-in access
					- From a security standpoint, enabling the option to connect remotely to a network device carries with it the responsibility of vigilant device security
				- Network ports
					- The router has many network ports, including LAN or WAN media ports, which may be copper or fiber cable
					- IP addresses are assigned to network ports
