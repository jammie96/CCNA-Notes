### Role of a Router #Routers 
- Routers belong to a series but within the series, different models can be found characterized by different hardware profiles
- Cisco routers can be categorized in:
	- Branch Routers
	- Service Provider Routers
	- Virtual Routers
	- Small Business Routers

#### Branch Routers
- All branch routers are designed to offer a wide range of network and security services and also be usable in the software-defined WAN environment
- Branch Router generally use the IOS XE operating system
- E.g. of branch routers: Cisco Catalyst 8000 Series, Cisco 1000 Series Integrated Services Routers and Cisco 4000 Series Integrated Services Routers
- Cisco Catalyst 8000 Series Edge Platforms with Cisco IOS SD-WAN Software deliver Cisco's secure, cloud-scale SD-WAN solution for the branch
- Catalyst 8300 Series is purpose-built for high-performance and integrated SD-WAN Services along with the flexibility to deliver security and networking services together from the cloud or on-premises
- The Catalyst 8000 Series Edge Platforms have a wide variety of interface options to choose from
	- Ranging from lower and higher module density with backward compatibility to a variety of existing WAN, LAN and voice and compute modules
- Cisco 1000 Series ISRs are a small-form-factor platform that is best suited for small and midsize businesses, enterprise branches and as customer premises equipment in managed services environments
- The ISR 4000 Series consolidates many must-have IT functions, including network, security, compute, storage and unified communications
	- It integrates the Cisco UCS E-Series server along with connectivity options and 4G and readiness for 5G being everything needed in a branch in a single platform
#### Service Provider Routers
- Serves billions of devices with low-latency services and high bandwidth demand, scales with bandwidth demand
- Most of the Service Providers routers work on an IOS XR operating System, which is an operating system built by Cisco that is designed for high scalability and stability
	- Among this router category, we can find ASR and NCS series routers
- Cisco NCS 5500 Network Convergence System Series Routers are designed for mass scale Metro and WAN Aggregation
	- They come in multiple form factors depending on requirements, typically leveraging modular design to allow for efficient expansion and scaling when required
	- These routers support ports with up to 400GbE port density
- The ASR 9000 Series is an edge routing device capable of supporting the application performance required to power 5G service needs
- They are characterized by the top of the industry throughput and reliability, representing the state of the art for edge and core routing
