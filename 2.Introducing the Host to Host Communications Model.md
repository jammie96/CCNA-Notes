#### Overview\
- Sources of messages are end devices, also called endpoints or hosts
![[Pasted image 20240928122206.png]]
- The messages are created at the source, transferred over the network and delivered to the destination
- Successful communication = Message has to traverse one or more networks
- A network interconnects a large number of devices produced by different hardware and software manufacturers over many different transmission media
	- Makes the network complex
- 2 Commonly used models=  ISO OSI and TCP/IP
	- Both provide a model of networking that describes internetworking functions and a set of rules called protocol that set out requirements for internetworking functions
- Layers group networking tasks by the functions that they perform in implementing network
	- Each layer has a particular role
	- Vertical Communication = a layer deals with the layer above it
	- Horizontal Communication = A layer at the source creates data that is intended for the same layer on the destination device
- TCP/IP is a protocol suite #TCP/IP
- A networking protocol is a set of rules that describe one type of communication
- ISO OSI aims at providing guidance for any type of computer system and it is used in comparing and contrasting different systems #ISO/OSI
	- Also called the Reference model
- Standards based, layered models provide several benefits:
	- Make complexity manageable by breaking communication tasks into smaller, simpler functional groups
	- Define and specify communication tasks to provide the same basis for everyone to develop their own solutions
	- Facilitate modular engineering, allowing different types of network hardware and software to communicate with one another
	- Prevent changes in one layer from affecting the other layers
	- Accelerate evolution, providing effective updates and improvements to individual components without affecting other components or having to rewrite the entire protocol
	- Simplify teaching and learning
- Data refers to information in an electronic form that could be stored and processed by a computer
- Different data transfer protocols requires completely different network topologies, equipment and interconnections
	- E.g. IP, AppleTalk, Token Ring, FDDI
- In addition to data transfer, other communication networks existed in parallel
	- E.g. telephone networks were built using separate equipment and implemented different protocols and standards
	- Now IP becomes standard

#### ISO OSI Reference Model #ISO/OSI 
- Serves as a framework on which a suite of protocols can be built
	- These set of protocols would be used to develop an international network that would not depend on proprietary systems
		- Proprietary = one company or a small group of company uses their own interpretation of tasks and processes to implement networking
- Describes how data is transferred over a network
	- Addresses hardware and software equipment and transmission

Please Do Not Throw Sausage Pizza Away #OSIReferenceModel
##### Layer 1 - Physical Layer (Please)
- Defines electrical, mechanical, procedural and functional specifications for activating, maintaining and de-activating the physical link between devices
- Deals with the electromagnetic representation of bits of data and their transmission
- Defines line encoding, voltage levels, timing of voltage changes, physical data rates, maximum transmission distances, physical connectors and other attributes
- The only layer implemented solely in hardware
- Unit = <u>Bits, Binary transmission</u>
##### Layer 2 - Data Link Layer (Do)
- Defines how data is formatted for transmission and controlled access to physical media
- Includes <u>Error Detection and Correction</u> to help ensure reliable data delivery
- Involves Network Interface Controller (NIC) to Network Interface Controller (NIC) (NIC-to-NIC) communication within the same network or subnet
- Uses physical address, sometimes called a <u>MAC Address</u> to identify hosts on the local network #MACAddress
- Unit = <u>Frames</u>
- Access to media (Switches)

##### Layer 3 - Network Layer (Not)
- Provides connectivity and path selection beyond the local segment, all the way from the source to the final destination
- Network layer uses logical addressing to manage connectivity
	- Logical address is used to identify the sender and the recipient #LogicalAddress
- Network logical address are determined by the network layer rules
	- Logical addressing helps ensure that a host has a unique address or that it can be uniquely identified in terms of network communication
- Unit = <u>Packet</u>
- Data Delivery (Router)
##### Layer 4 - Transport Layer (Throw)
- Defines the segmenting and reassembling of data belonging to multiple individual communications
- Defines the flow control
- Defines the mechanisms for reliable transport if required
- Serves the upper layers, which in turn interface with many user applications
- Uses its own addressing
	- Is only valid locally, within one host
- Can be both reliable and unreliable
	- Selection of the appropriate service depends on application requirements
	- E.g. the file transfer may be reliable to guarantee that the file arrives intact and whole
	- On the other hand, a missing pixel when watching a video might go unnoticed
- Unit = <u>Segment</u>
- End-to-End Connections
	- E.g. Load balancing, firewall

##### Layer 5 - Session (Sausage)
- Establishes, manages and terminates sessions between 2 communicating hosts to allow them to exchange data over a prolonged time period
- Mainly concerned with issues that application processes may encounter and not with lower layer connectivity issues
	- These sessions, called dialogs, can determine whether to handle data in both directions simultaneously or only handle data flow in one direction at a time
	- It also takes care of checkpoints and recovery mechanisms
- Is explicitly implemented with applications that use remote procedure calls
- Interhost communication

##### Layer 6 - Presentation Layer (Pizza)
- Helps ensure that data sent by the application layer of one system is "readable" by the application layer of another system
	- Achieves that by translating data into a standard format before transmission and converting it into a format known to the receiving application layer
- Provides special data processing that must be done before transmission
- May compress or decompress data to improve the throughput and may encrypt and decrypt data to improve security
	- Compression/Decompression and Encryption/Decryption may also be done at lower levels 
- Data representation

##### Layer 7 - Application Layer (Away)
- Closest to the user
- Provides services to user applications that want to use the network
	- Services include email, file transfer and terminal emulation
- E.g. Web browser (HTTP), does not reside at the application layer but uses protocols that operate at the application layer
- Operating systems also use the application layer when performing tasks triggered by actions that typically do not involve communication over the network
	- E.g. opening a remotely located file with a text editor or importing a remotely located file into a spreadsheet
- Does not provide services to any other OSI layer
- Network process to application

#### TCP/IP Protocol Suite #TCP/IP 
![[Pasted image 20240928185848.png]]
- Represents a protocol suite
- Defines and describes requirements for the implementation of host systems
	- These include standard protocols that these systems should use
	- Does not specify how to implement the protocol functions but provides guidance for vendors, implementors and users of what should be provided within the system
- TCP = Transmission Control Protocol
- IP = Internet Protocol
- Layers represented by these 2 protocols carry out functions crucial to successful network communication

##### TCP/IP Protocol - Link Layer
- Also known as Media Access Layer
- Defines protocols used to interface the directly connected network
- Tasks are close related to the characteristics of the physical medium and deal primarily with physical network details
- Also referred to as a network interface, network access or even data link layer
- E.g. Ethernet
	- Introduces physical addresses, sometimes called hardware addresses or MAC addresses, used to identify devices sharing a particular physical network segment
- Working with OSI = <u>Data Link Layer and Physical layer</u>
##### TCP/IP Protocol - Internet Layer
- Routes data from the source to the destination
- Provides a means to obtain information on reaching other networks and deals with reporting errors
- Provides logical addresses #LogicalAddress 
	- Helps ensure that a host is uniquely identified #LogicalAddress 
	- E.g. IP address, used to identify a host
		- Address is valid globally and aims at uniquely identifying the host #ip 
- IP Protocols, IPv4 and IPv6 reside in this layer #IPv4 #IPv6 
-  Working with OSI = <u>Internet Layer</u>

##### TCP/IP Protocol - Transport Layer
- Core of the TCP/IP architecture and the Internet layer
	- Placed between "data mover" protocols of the link and internet layers and software-oriented protocols of the application layer
- There are 2 main protocols at this layer, TCP and UDP
	- Serves many application-layer protocols
- Transport services "prepare" application data for transfer over the network, follow the transfer process and ensure that data from different applications is not mixed
- To distinguish between the applications, the transport layer identifies each application with its own addressing
	- This addressing is valid locally, within one host, unlike addressing, which is valid globally
- Working with OSI = <u>Transport Layer</u>
##### TCP/IP Protocol - Application Layer
- Main deal with user interaction
- It supports user applications by providing protocols and services that let you actually use the network
- It supports network Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) that allow programs to access the network services, regardless of the operating system that they are running on
- Accomodates protocol such as HTTP, HTTPS, Domain Name Systen (DNS), FTP, Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP), Secure Shell (SSH)
- These protocols facilitate applications for web browsing, file transfer, names to IP addresses resolution, sending of emails, remote access to devices 
- Working with OSI = <u>Session Layer, Application Layer and Presentation Layer</u>

#### Peer-to-Peer Communications
- Peer-to-peer is often used to indicate an application architecture in which application tasks and workloads are equally distributed among peers
	- Opposite is client-server architecture in which tasks and workload are unequally divided
![[Pasted image 20240928211605.png]]
- In order for application data to reach the recipient, it first needs to reach the directly connected physical network
	- Data is said to pass down the local protocol stack
- First, an application protocol takes user data and processes it
	- When processing by the application protocol is done, it passes processed data down to the transport layer, which does it processing
		- The logic continues down the rest of the protocol stack until data is ready for physical transmission\
		- The data processing that happens as data traverses the protocol stack alters the initial data
- On the receiving side, the process is reversed
- The signals that arrive at the destination host are received from the media by the link layer, which serves data to the internet layer
- From there, data is passed up the stack all the way to the receiving application
- Then, the data received as the electromagnetic signal is different from the data that will be delivered to the application
- Passing data up and down the stack is also referred to as vertical communication
- For the horizontal, peer-to-peer communication of layers to happen, it first requires vertical down the stank and up the stack communication
- Data : General term for the PDU that is used at the application layer
- Segment : Transport layer PDU
- Packet : Internet layer PDU
- Frame : Link layer PDU
- Wireshark (packet analyzer) allows to look into PDUs from peer-to-peer communication
