#### Overview\
- Sources of messages are end devices, also called endpoints or hosts
![[Pasted image 20240928122206.png]]
- The messages are created at the source, transferred over the network and delivered to the destination
- Successful communication = Message has to traverse one or more networks
- A network interconnects a large number of devices produced by different hardware and software manufacturers over many different transmission media
	- Makes the network complex
- 2 Commonly used models=  ISO OSI and TCP/IP
	- Both provide a model of networking that describes internetworking functions and a set of rules called protocol that set out requirements for internetworking functions
- Layers group networking tasks by the functions that they perform in implementing network
	- Each layer has a particular role
	- Vertical Communication = a layer deals with the layer above it
	- Horizontal Communication = A layer at the source creates data that is intended for the same layer on the destination device
- TCP/IP is a protocol suite #TCP/IP
- A networking protocol is a set of rules that describe one type of communication
- ISO OSI aims at providing guidance for any type of computer system and it is used in comparing and contrasting different systems #ISO/OSI
	- Also called the Reference model
- Standards based, layered models provide several benefits:
	- Make complexity manageable by breaking communication tasks into smaller, simpler functional groups
	- Define and specify communication tasks to provide the same basis for everyone to develop their own solutions
	- Facilitate modular engineering, allowing different types of network hardware and software to communicate with one another
	- Prevent changes in one layer from affecting the other layers
	- Accelerate evolution, providing effective updates and improvements to individual components without affecting other components or having to rewrite the entire protocol
	- Simplify teaching and learning
- Data refers to information in an electronic form that could be stored and processed by a computer
- Different data transfer protocols requires completely different network topologies, equipment and interconnections
	- E.g. IP, AppleTalk, Token Ring, FDDI
- In addition to data transfer, other communication networks existed in parallel
	- E.g. telephone networks were built using separate equipment and implemented different protocols and standards
	- Now IP becomes standard
