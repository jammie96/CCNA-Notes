### Internet Protocol #ip 
- IP uses packets to carry information through the network
	- A packet is a self-contained, independent entity that contains data and sufficient information to be routed from the source to the destination without reliance on previous packets
- IP has these characteristics:
	- Operates at Layer 3 or the network layer of OSI reference model and at the Internet layer of the TCP/IP stack
	- Connectionless protocol
		- One way packet is sent to the destination without advance notification to the destination device
		- Destination device receives the data and does not return any status information to the sending device
	- Each packet is treated independently, can travel a different way to the destination
		- Also operates independently of the medium that is carrying the data
	- Uses hierarchical addressing, network identification is the equivalent of a street, host ID is equivalent of a house or office building on the street
	- Provides service on a best-effort basis and does not guarantee packet delivery
		- Packet can be misdirected, duplicated or lost on the way to its destination
	- Does not provide any special features that recover corrupted packets
		- The end systems of the network provide these services
	- IPv4 and IPv6, IPv6 becoming increasingly important in modern networks

### IPv4 Address Representation
- IPv4 Address is a 32-bit number, is hierarchical and consists of 2 parts:
	- The network address portion (network ID)
		- Uniquely identifies the network in which the device with this IPv4 address resides
		- If the hosts need to communicate with devices with interfaces assigned to some other network ID, a network device (router or a multilayer switch) can route data between the networks
	- The host address portion (host ID)
		- Uniquely identifies a device on a given IPv4 network
		- Assigned to individual devices, both hosts or endpoints and intermediary devices

> Sample of how IP address, in dotted-decimal notation
> Consists of 4 sets of 8 bits (octets)
### IPv4 Header Fields
![[Pasted image 20241007143957.png]]
- Has several fields:
	- Service type = Provides information on the desired quality of service
	- TTL = Defines the number of available hopes and limits the lifetime of a packet
		- Does not use time measurement units, uses per hop 
	- Source address = Specifies the 32-bit binary value that represents the IPv4 address of the sending endpoint
	- Destination address = Specifies the 32-bit binary value that represents the IPv4 address of the receiving endpoint
- Other fields:
	- Version = Describes the version of IP
	- IHL = Internet Header Length, describes the length of the header
	- Total Length = Describes the length of the packet, including header and data
	- Identification = Used for unique fragment identification
	- Flag = Sets various control flags regarding fragmentation
	- Fragment Offset = Indicates where a specific fragment belongs
	- Protocol  = Indicates the upper-layer protocol that is used in the data portion of an IPv4 packet
		- For example, a protocol value of 6 indicates this packet carries a TCP segment
	- Header checksum = Used for header error detection
	- Options = Includes optional parameters
	- Padding= Used to ensure that the header ends on a 32-bit boundary
### IPv4 Address Classes
- Assigning IPv4 addresses to classes is known as classful addressing
	- Each IPv4 address is broken down into a network ID and a host  ID
	- A bit or a bit sequence at the start of each address determines the class of the address
- Classes defines the network part of the IP address, which cannot be changed, and the host part of the IP address can be selected and used (if the IP address is available)
- For example:
![[Pasted image 20241007152830.png]]

![[Pasted image 20241007153029.png]]
> Classes overview
> *127.0.0.0 - 127.255.255.255 is used for loopback and diagnostic functions
#### Class A
- Designed to support extremely large networks with more than 16 million host addresses
- Uses only the first 8 bits 
	- The remaining is used for host addresses
- First bit is always 0, highest number represented is 0111 1111 (127), but cannot be represented as it is reserved
#### Class B
- Designed to support the needs of moderate to large networks with more than 65,000 hosts
- Uses 16 bits to indicate the network address
- Starts with 10, lowest number that can be represented is 1000 0000 (128 ) and between the range of 128-191
#### Class C
- Most commonly available address class
- Intended to provide address for small networks with a maximum of 254 hosts
- Uses 24 bits 
- Starts with 110, lowest number is 1100 0000 (192) and between the range of 192-223
#### Class D
- Dedicated to multicast applications such as streaming media
	- Multicasts are a special type of broadcast in that only hosts that request to participate in the multicast group will receive the traffic to the IPv4 address of that group
- Multicast addresses are always the destination address and never the source
- Begins with 1110, lowest is 1110 0000 (224), range between 224-239
#### Class E
- Reserved by IANA as a block of experimental addresses
- Should never be assigned to IPv4 hosts
- Begins with 1111, lowest number 1111 0000 (240), range between 240-255

### Subnet Masks
- Is a 32-bit number that describes which portion of an IPv4 address refers to the network ID and which part refers to the host ID
- Is configured on a device along with the IPv4 address
- The main purpose of subnet mask is to identify the network address of a host, which is crucial for routing purposes
- Based on the network address, the host can identify whether a packet's destination address is within the same network or not
![[Pasted image 20241007155933.png]]
> Prefix /16 is another way of expressing the subnet mask and matches the number of network bits that are set to binary 1 in the subnet mask
#### Calculating the Network address
- 1 AND 1 = 1, the rest 0

### Subnets
![[Pasted image 20241007162836.png]]
>Flat topology
- Flat topology is an OSI Layer 2 - switch connected network where all devices see all the broadcasts in the Layer 2 broadcast domain
- Flat network design is easy to implement and manage, reducing cost, maintenance and administration
- Concerns:
	- Security
		- Because network is not segmented, you cannot apply security policies adapted to individual segments
		- If one device is compromised, it can quickly affect the whole network
	- Troubleshooting
		- Isolation of network faults is more challenging, especially in bigger flat networks because there is not logical separation or hierarchy
	- Address space utilization
		- Can end up with a lot of wasted IP addresses, cannot use addresses from this network anywhere else
	- Scalability and speed
		- A flat network represents a single Layer 2 broadcast domain
		- If there is a large amount of broadcast traffic, this can impose considerable pressure on the available resources
		- A single broadcast domain typically should not include more than a couple hundred of devices


![[Pasted image 20241007162806.png]]
> Segmented networks
- Benefits of segmented networks
	- Smaller networks are easier to manage and map to geographical or functional requirements
	- Better utilization of IP addressing space, because you can adapt subnets sizes
	- Enables to create multiple logical networks from a single network prefix
	- Traffic is reduced, which can improve performance
	- Easily apply network security measures at the interconnections between subnets than within a single large network

### Implementing Subnetting: Borrowing bits #subnetting
- Steps to implement subnet:
	- Determine the IP address for your network as assigned by the registry authority or network administrator
	- Based on your organizational and administrative structure, determine the number of subnets that are required for the network (be sure to plan for growth)
	- Based on the required number of subnets, determine the number of bits that you need to borrow from the host bits
	- Determine the binary and decimal value of the new subnet mask that results from borrowing bits from the host ID
	- Apply the subnet mask to the network IP address to determine the subnets and the available host addresses. Also determine the network and broadcast address for each subnet
	- Assign subnet addresses to all subnets. Assign host address to all devices that are connected to each subnet

![[Pasted image 20241013144056.png]]
> Borrowing bits:
> Notice changing /24 prefix to /25 prefix
> Notice from 4th octect, 0 to 128  as it is in binary

- Each time a bit is borrowed, the number of subnet addresses increases and the number of host addresses that are available per subnet decreases
	- E.g. Number of subnets: 2<sup>s</sup> (where s is the number of bits borrowed)

- 2 addresses that are not available to be used as host address =  directed broadcast address (all 1 bits) & local broadcast address (all 0 bits)
	- E.g. Calculate the number of host addresses that are available: 2<sup>h</sup> -2 (h if the number of host bits that are remaining after bits are borrowed)
![[Pasted image 20241013145027.png]]
> Class B subnet mask, 255.255.0.0

> 	- 192.168.52.255 = directed broadcast #important 
> 	- 192.168.52.0 = network broadcast #important

> Example of 5 host bits are borrowed for subnetting, Class B subnet mask, 255.255.0.0
> 2<sup>5</sup> = 32 subnets are created
> 	2<sup>3</sup> - 2 = 6 host addresses are available for each subnet
> Therefore, new subnet mask is 1111 1111. 1111 1111. 1111 1111. 1111 1000 = 255.255.255.248 \

### Implementing Subnetting: Determining the Addressing Scheme #subnetting
- If all network address is subnetted, the first subnet that is obtained after subnetting the network address is called subnet zero

<b>Example 1</b>

>  172.16.1.0
>  ...
>  172.16.255.0 = 256 subnets (start from 0)
>  Each subnet there are 2<sup>8</sup> - 2 = 254 usable host address per subnet

### Benefits of VLSM and Implementing VLSM
- Variable Length Subnet Mask (VLSM) allows you to use more than one subnet mask within a network to efficiently use IP addresses
- The most efficient subnet mask for a subnet is the mask that provides an appropriate number of host addresses for that individual subnet
![[Pasted image 20241013204833.png]]
> Subnet 172.16.6.0 has only 19 hosts, so it does not need the 254 host addresses that the /24 prefix allows
> 	- A /27 mask would provide 30 host addresses which is more appropriate for this subnet

- Benefits of VLSM:
	- Support for route summarization / route aggregation
		- Route summarization reduces the number of routes in routing tables by representing a range of network subnets in a single summary address
			- Smaller routing tables require less CPU time for routing lookups
- VLSM can be used in all modern networks that run classless routing protocols such as Routing Information Protocol version 2 (RIPv2), Open Shortest Path Firts (OSPF #OSPF), Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol (EIGRP)
- VLSM could not be used on a network using legacy classful protocols such as Routing Information Protocol version 1 (RIPv1) and Interior Gateway Routing Protocol (IGRP)
	- These protocols cannot carry subnet mask information on their routing updates and are no longer used in today's networks

### Private vs Public IPv4 Addresses
#### Public IPv4 Addresses
- Businesses and home internet users receive their IP address assignment from their Local Internet Registry (LIR), which is typically their ISP
	- These IP addresses are called provider aggregatable (as opposed to provider-independent addresses) because they are linked to the ISP
	- If you change change ISPs, you will need to readdress your internet-facing hosts

| IPv4 Address Class | Public IPv4 Address Range     |
| ------------------ | ----------------------------- |
| A                  | 1.0.0.0 - 9.255.255.255       |
|                    | 11.0.0.0 - 126.255.255.255    |
| B                  | 128.0.0 - 172.15.255.255      |
|                    | 172.32.0.0 - 191.255.255.255  |
| C                  | 192.0.0 - 192.167.255.255     |
|                    | 192.169.0.0 - 223.255.255.255 |
#PulicIPAddressRange
- LIRs obtain IP address pools from their Regional Internet Registry (RIR):
	- African Network Information Center (AFRINIC)
	- Asia Pacific Network Information Center (APNIC)
	- American Registry for Internet Numbers (ARIN)
	- Latin American and Caribbean Network Information Center (LACNIC)
	- Reseaux IP Europeens Network Coordincation Centre (RIPE NCC)
- With the rapid growth of the internet, IPc4 addresses began to run out
	- New mechanisms such as NAT, CIDR, VLSM and IPv6 were developed to help solve the problem

#### Private IPv4 Addresses
- Addresses in these rangers are not routed on the internet backbone
- Internet routers are configured to discard private addresses
	- These private addresses can be used instead of globally unique addresses
- When a network that uses private addresses must connect to the internet, it must be translated to public addresses
	- Called Network Address Translation (NAT) #NAT 
	- A router is often the network device that performs NAT

| IPv4 Address Class | Public IPv4 Address Range |
| ------------------ | ------------------------- |
| A                  | 10.0.0.0/8                |
| B                  | 172.16.0.0/12             |
| C                  | 192.168.0.0/16            |

### Reserved IPv4 Addresses
- Reserved IPv4 addresses include a network address used to identify the network itself and a broadcast address, which is used for broadcasting packets to all the devices on a network
#### Network Address
- Standard way to refer to a network
	- Has binary zeros in all the host bit positions
- E.g. Class A network, 10.0.0.0 is the IPv4 address of the network containing the host 10.1.2.3
	- All hosts in 10.0.0.0 will have the same network bits
- A router uses the network IPv4 address when it searches its IPv4 routing table for the destination network location
- When networks are subnetted, the IPv4 address with binary zeros in all the host bit positions is still reserved for the address of the subnet
	- E.g. 172.16.1.0/24 is the address of the subnet

#### Local Broadcast address
- If an IPv4 device wants to communicate with all the devices on the local network, it sets the destination address to all ones (255.255.255.255) and transmits the packet
- E.g. hosts that do not know their network number will use the 255.255.255.255 broadcast address to ask a server for the network address
- The local broadcast is never routed beyond the local network or subnet
![[Pasted image 20241020164713.png]]

#### Directed Broadcast Address
- The broadcast IPv4 address of a network is a special address for each network that allows communication to all the hosts in that network
- To send data to all the hosts in a network, a host can send a single packet that is addressed to the broadcast address of the network
- The broadcast address uses the highest address in the network range, which is the address in which all of the bits in the host portion are all ones.
- For network 10.0.0.0/8 with 8 network bits, the broadcast address would be 10.255.255.255
	- This is known as directed broadcast
![[Pasted image 20241020165025.png]]
> Assuming a hypothetical network in which every IPv4 host address was in use on the 10.0.0.0/8 network, a ping to 10.255.255.255 would receive a response from all 16,777,214 hosts
> - 172.,16.0.0/16 (last 16 bits of host bits) -> sent out to all devices on that network would have a destination address of 172.16.255.255
> - 192.168.11.0/24 (last 8 bits of host bits) -> sent out to all devices on that network would have a destination address of 192.168.11.255
> - For a subnet address 192.168.11.32/28 (last 4 bits of host bits) -> sent out to all devices on that network would have a destination address of 192.168.11.47


#### Local Loopback Address
- Used to let the system send a message to itself for testing
- Creates a shortcut method for TCP/IP applications and services that run on the same device to communicate with one another
- Typical loopback IPv4 address is 127.0.0.1
- This is done to make sure that the system's network software and hardware is functioning correctly

#### Autoconfiguration IPv4 Addresses
- When neither a statically nor a dynamically configured IPv4 address is found on startup, those hosts supporting IPv4 link-local addresses (RFC 3927) will generate an address in the 169.254.0.0/16 range
- This address can be used only for local network connectivity and operates with many caveats, one of which is that it will not be routed
	- Will mostly see this address as a failure condition when a PC fails to obtain an address via DHCP
- This feature called Automatic Private IP Addressing (APIPA) is implemented in Microsoft and Apple operating systems

#### IP Addresses for Documentation
- Address blocks 198.51.100.0/24 and 203.0.113.0/24 are assigned for use in documentation and example code
- Often used along with example.com or example.net domain names in vendor and protocol documentation
- As described in RFC 5727, addresses within these blocks do not legitimately appear on the public internet and can be used without any coordination with IANA or an internet registry

#### All Zeros Address
- 0.0.0.0 indicates the host in "this" network and is used only as a source address
- An example use case is the DHCP assignment process before the host has a valid IPv4 address

### Verifying IPv4 Address of a host
- Dynamic IP address is assigned automatically and changes whenever a user reboots a device

Steps to verify IPv4 Addresses
