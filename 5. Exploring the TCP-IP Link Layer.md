### Ethernet LAN Connection Media
- Ethernet is a network standard published by Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE)
- IEEE 802.3 and Ethernet are used synonymously but are different
	- IEEE 802.3 is used when referring to a specific part of the standard, such as a particular frame format
	- Ethernet is a set of guidelines that enable various network components to work together
		- These guidelines specify cabling and signaling at the physical and data link layers of the OSI model
		- Ethernet standards recommend different types of cabling and specify maximum segment lengths for each type
- The names of the standards specify the transmission speed, the type of signaling and the type of cabling
	- E.g. 1000BASE-T:
		- 1000 = Specifies a transmission speed of 1000 Megabits per second (Mbps) or 1 Gigabit per second (Gbps)
		- BASE = Baseband signaling, only Ethernet signals are carried on the medium
		- T = Twisted-pair cabling
- Twisted-pair cabling is a type of wiring in which 2 conductors are twisted together for the purpose of cancelling Electromagnetic Interference (EMI) from external sources #EMI

- TIA = Telecommunications Industry Association
- UTP = Unshielded Twisted Pair
- ISO = International Organization for Standardization
- RJ = Registered Jack

- The mechanical properties of Ethernet, such as speed, link and distance, depends on the type of physical medium
	- Coaxial (not used anymore)
	- Twisted-pair copper
	- Fiber optics
- Ethernet was originally based on the concept of computers communicating over a shared coaxial cable
- For optical media connections in an enterprise environment, the usual optical connector types are Lucent Connector (LC), Standard Connector (SC), Multi-fiber Termination Push-on (MTP) and Straight-Tip (ST)
	- Ferrule Connector (FC) is common in service provider equipment

- An optical transmitter converts an electrical signal to an optical signal
	- A fiber optic cables carries the optical signal from an optical transmitter to an optical receiver, and reconverts it to the electrical signal for on-device processing
- The inner parts of devices operate by using an electrical signal
	- Transmitters are used to convert an electrical signal into an optical signal and receivers are used to change an optical signal back to the electrical
- Transmission within the device is electrically different from the transmission over wire even in copper cables
- Optical transmission processing includes generating a light impulse
	- E.g. 1= on light, 0= off light
- Electical transmission processing:
	- 1= generate 10V
	- 0= generate -10V

- Both electrical and optical signals suffer from similar problems during transmission
	- Impule examples (Voltage) between the transmitter and the receiver show the signal degradation due to attenuation
 		- For signal degradation and timing reasons, segments between the nodes have a restricted size (size)
   	- Electrical noise, unwanted signal disturbance
		- Poor connections and patch cables are the main sources
   		- Industrial electrical noise sources are automobiles, airplanes, electric motors, switching gears, high-voltage transmission cables and fluorescent lamps
   	 		- Produced by the source's electrical discharge
   	  	- Natural electrical noise might be from lightning discharges in thunderstorms
   	  		- From the sun, solar noise
   	  	 	- Distant stars, cosmic noise
   	  	  		- While these are too far away to individually affect terrestrial communications systems, their large number leads to appreciable collective effects
   	  	    	- Apart from thtat, there is a substantial amount of signal disruption from artificial electrical noise
   	  	 
#### Copper Media
- Most Ethernet networks use unshielded twisted-pair (UTP) copper cabling for short and medium-length distances because of its low cost compared to fiber-optic or coaxial cable
![[Pasted image 20241026121127.png]]

| Characteristic           | Value                   |
| ------------------------ | ----------------------- |
| Speed and throughput     | From 10 Mbps to 40 Gbps |
| Average cost per node    | Least expensive         |
| Media and connector size | Small                   |
| Maximum cable length     | 100 m (30m for 40Gbps)  |
- Several categories of UTP cables exist:
	- Category 5:
		- Capable of transmitting data at speeds of up to 100 Mbps
	- Category 5e:
		- Used in networks running at speeds of up to 1000 Mbps (1 Gbps)
	- Category 6:
		- Comprises 4 pairs of 24-gauge copper wires, which can transmit data at speeds of up to 10 Gbps
	- Category 6a:
		- Used in networks running at speeds of up to 10 Gbps
	- Category 7:
		- Used in networks running at speeds of up to 10 Gbps
	- Category 8:
		- Used in networks running at speeds of up to 40 Gbps

#### RJ-45 Connector and Jack
- UTP cables are used with RJ-45 connectors
![[Pasted image 20241026121505.png]]
- RJ-45 plug is the male component, which is crimped at the end of the cable
	- Pin locations are numbered from 8 on the left to 1 on the right
- Jack is the female component in a network device, wall cubicle partition outlet or patch panel
	- Pin locations are numbered from 1 on the left to 8 on the right
- Structures cabling is installed during the building construction phase in modern business environments
	- The cables are routed from the wiring closet to the sockets in the walls or on office desks
	- To connect to the local network, you would connect the computer's network adaptor, to the wall socket by using UTP cable with a male RJ-45 connector on both ends

![[Pasted image 20241026121833.png]]
>Notice that the cable from the wall socket to the wiring closet is called horizontal cabling
>	- Vertical cabling is the term usually reserved for links between wiring closets
#### Power over Ethernet (PoE) #PoE
- Passes electric power along with data on Ethernet cabling
	- Allows a single Ethernet cable to provide both data connection and electric power to devices such as wireless access points, IP cameras and VoIP phones by using all 4 pairs in the Category 5 cable or above
#### Straight-Through or a Crossover UTP Cable ?
- Straight-through cables are primarily used to connect electrically unlike devices
- Crossover cables are used to connect electrically like devices
- E.g. the receive pin is the same on both devices, so it must be crossed to the transmit pin
![[Pasted image 20241026174316.png]]
>To tell the different between the 2 types, hold the ends of the cable next to each other, with the connector side of each end facing you
	- The cable is a straight-through cable if some of the wires on one end of the cable are crossed to a different pin on the other side of the cable
- When automatic medium-dependent interface crossover (auto-MDIX) is enabled on an interface, the interface automatically detects the required cable connection type (straight-through or crossover) and configures the connection appropriately
	- With auto-MDIX enables, you can use either type of cable to connect to other devices and the interface automatically corrects for any incorrect cabling
- The need for crossover cables is considered legacy as most devices now use straight-through cables and can internally cross-connect when a crossover is required #important 
![[Pasted image 20241026174623.png]]

#### Optical Fiber
![[Pasted image 20241026175105.png]]
- Is a flexible, transparent fiber that is made of very pure glass (silica) and is not much larger than human hair
	- Acts as a waveguide, or light pipe, to transmit light between the two ends of the fiber
- Optical fibers are widely used in fiber-optic communication, which permits transmission over longer distances and at higher bandwidths (data rates) than other forms of communication
- Fibers are used instead of metal wires because signals travel with less loss and immunity to EMI #EMI
- The 2 fundamental components that allow fiber to confine light are the core and the cladding
	- Most of light travels from the beginning to the end inside the core
	- The cladding around the core provides confinement
	- The diameters of the core may vary for various fiber types
	- The outer diameter of the cladding is a standard size of 125 micrometers
	- Standardizing the size means that component manufacturers can make connectors for all fiber-optic cables
- The buffer (coating) has nothing to do with the confinement of the light in the fiber
	- Its purpose is to protect the glass from scratches and moisture
		- The fiber-optic cable can be easily scratched and broken
	- If the fiber is scratches, the scratch could propagate and break the fiber
	- Another important role of the buffer is to keep the fiber dry

**Fiber Types**
![[Pasted image 20241026175548.png]]

| MMF Characteristics             | SMF Characteristics               |
| ------------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| LED transmitter is usually used | Laser transmitter is usually used |
| Lower bandwidth and speed       | Higher bandwidth and speed        |
| Shorter distances               | Longer distances                  |
| Less expensive                  | More expensive                    |

- Most significant difference between multimode fiber (MMF) and single-mode fiber (SMF) is in the ability to send light over a long distance at high bit rates
	- MMF is used for shorter distances, SMF is preferred for long distance communications
- Another significant difference is in the size of the core
	- The glass in the 2 fibers is the same and the index of refraction (a way of measuring the speed of light in a material) between the core and the cladding changes similarly
	- The diameter of the fiber cladding is also the same
	- However, the core is a different size, which affects how the light gets through the fiber
		- MMF supports multiple ways for the light from one source to travel through the fiber
			- Each path can be thought of as a mode
		- For SMF, the possible ways for the light to get through the fiber have been reduced to one, as a useful approximation
- MMF uses LED as a light source, which facilitates short-distance transmissions
- SMF uses a laser to generate the signal, which provides higher transmission rates

![[Pasted image 20241026194814.png]]
> Generally, organizations standardize on one type of connector, depending on the equipment that they commonly use, or they standardize per type of fiber (one for MMF and for SMF)

- There are 3 types of connector
	- Threaded
	- Bayonet
	- Push-pull
- Connectors are mode of the following materials:
	- Plastic sleeve
	- Metal
- Here is a list of the most common types of fiber connectors and their typical uses:
	- LC = for enterprise equipment and is commonly used on Small Form-Factor Pluggable (SFP) modules
	- SC = for enterprise equipment
	- ST = for patch panels (for their durability)
	- FC = is for patch panels and is used by service providers
	- MT-RJ = two-fiber connector (transmit and receive), has a form factor and is used for enterprise equipment
- Small Form Factor (SFF) connectors (E.g. LCs) are replacing the traditional connectors (E.g. SC) mainly to pack more connectors on the faceplate and, as a result, reduce system footprints
