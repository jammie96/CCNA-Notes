### Ethernet LAN Connection Media
- Ethernet is a network standard published by Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE)
- IEEE 802.3 and Ethernet are used synonymously but are different
	- IEEE 802.3 is used when referring to a specific part of the standard, such as a particular frame format
	- Ethernet is a set of guidelines that enable various network components to work together
		- These guidelines specify cabling and signaling at the physical and data link layers of the OSI model
		- Ethernet standards recommend different types of cabling and specify maximum segment lengths for each type
- The names of the standards specify the transmission speed, the type of signaling and the type of cabling
	- E.g. 1000BASE-T:
		- 1000 = Specifies a transmission speed of 1000 Megabits per second (Mbps) or 1 Gigabit per second (Gbps)
		- BASE = Baseband signaling, only Ethernet signals are carried on the medium
		- T = Twisted-pair cabling

- TIA = Telecommunications Industry Association
- UTP = Unshielded Twisted Pair
- ISO = International Organization for Standardization
- RJ = Registered Jack

- The mechanical properties of Ethernet, such as speed, link and distance, depends on the type of physical medium
	- Coaxial (not used anymore)
	- Twisted-pair copper
	- Fiber optics
- Ethernet was originally based on the concept of computers communicating over a shared coaxial cable
- For optical media connections in an enterprise environment, the usual optical connector types are Lucent Connector (LC), Standard Connector (SC), Multi-fiber Termination Push-on (MTP) and Straight-Tip (ST)
	- Ferrule Connector (FC) is common in service provider equipment

- An optical transmitter converts an electrical signal to an optical signal
	- A fiber optic cables carries the optical signal from an optical transmitter to an optical receiver, and reconverts it to the electrical signal for on-device processing
- The inner parts of devices operate by using an electrical signal
	- Transmitters are used to convert an electrical signal into an optical signal and receivers are used to change an optical signal back to the electrical
- Transmission within the device is electrically different from the transmission over wire even in copper cables
- Optical transmission processing includes generating a light impulse
	- E.g. 1= on light, 0= off light
- Electical transmission processing:
	- 1= generate 10V
	- 0= generate -10V

- Both electrical and optical signals suffer from similar problems during transmission
	- Impule examples (Voltage) between the transmitter and the receiver show the signal degradation due to attenuation
 		- For signal degradation and timing reasons, segments between the nodes have a restricted size (size)
   	- Electrical noise, unwanted signal disturbance
		- Poor connections and patch cables are the main sources
   		- Industrial electrical noise sources are automobiles, airplanes, electric motors, switching gears, high-voltage transmission cables and fluorescent lamps
   	 		- Produced by the source's electrical discharge
   	  	- Natural electrical noise might be from lightning discharges in thunderstorms
   	  		- From the sun, solar noise
   	  	 	- Distant stars, cosmic noise
   	  	  		- While these are too far away to individually affect terrestrial communications systems, their large number leads to appreciable collective effects
   	  	    	- Apart from thtat, there is a substantial amount of signal disruption from artificial electrical noise
