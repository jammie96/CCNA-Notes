### Ethernet LAN Connection Media
- Ethernet is a network standard published by Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE)
- IEEE 802.3 and Ethernet are used synonymously but are different
	- IEEE 802.3 is used when referring to a specific part of the standard, such as a particular frame format
	- Ethernet is a set of guidelines that enable various network components to work together
		- These guidelines specify cabling and signaling at the physical and data link layers of the OSI model
		- Ethernet standards recommend different types of cabling and specify maximum segment lengths for each type
- The names of the standards specify the transmission speed, the type of signaling and the type of cabling
	- E.g. 1000BASE-T:
		- 1000 = Specifies a transmission speed of 1000 Megabits per second (Mbps) or 1 Gigabit per second (Gbps)
		- BASE = Baseband signaling, only Ethernet signals are carried on the medium
		- T = Twisted-pair cabling
- Twisted-pair cabling is a type of wiring in which 2 conductors are twisted together for the purpose of cancelling Electromagnetic Interference (EMI) from external sources #EMI

- TIA = Telecommunications Industry Association
- UTP = Unshielded Twisted Pair
- ISO = International Organization for Standardization
- RJ = Registered Jack

- The mechanical properties of Ethernet, such as speed, link and distance, depends on the type of physical medium
	- Coaxial (not used anymore)
	- Twisted-pair copper
	- Fiber optics
- Ethernet was originally based on the concept of computers communicating over a shared coaxial cable
- For optical media connections in an enterprise environment, the usual optical connector types are Lucent Connector (LC), Standard Connector (SC), Multi-fiber Termination Push-on (MTP) and Straight-Tip (ST)
	- Ferrule Connector (FC) is common in service provider equipment

- An optical transmitter converts an electrical signal to an optical signal
	- A fiber optic cables carries the optical signal from an optical transmitter to an optical receiver, and reconverts it to the electrical signal for on-device processing
- The inner parts of devices operate by using an electrical signal
	- Transmitters are used to convert an electrical signal into an optical signal and receivers are used to change an optical signal back to the electrical
- Transmission within the device is electrically different from the transmission over wire even in copper cables
- Optical transmission processing includes generating a light impulse
	- E.g. 1= on light, 0= off light
- Electical transmission processing:
	- 1= generate 10V
	- 0= generate -10V

- Both electrical and optical signals suffer from similar problems during transmission
	- Impule examples (Voltage) between the transmitter and the receiver show the signal degradation due to attenuation
 		- For signal degradation and timing reasons, segments between the nodes have a restricted size (size)
   	- Electrical noise, unwanted signal disturbance
		- Poor connections and patch cables are the main sources
   		- Industrial electrical noise sources are automobiles, airplanes, electric motors, switching gears, high-voltage transmission cables and fluorescent lamps
   	 		- Produced by the source's electrical discharge
   	  	- Natural electrical noise might be from lightning discharges in thunderstorms
   	  		- From the sun, solar noise
   	  	 	- Distant stars, cosmic noise
   	  	  		- While these are too far away to individually affect terrestrial communications systems, their large number leads to appreciable collective effects
   	  	    	- Apart from thtat, there is a substantial amount of signal disruption from artificial electrical noise
   	  	 
#### Copper Media
- Most Ethernet networks use unshielded twisted-pair (UTP) copper cabling for short and medium-length distances because of its low cost compared to fiber-optic or coaxial cable
![[Pasted image 20241026121127.png]]

| Characteristic           | Value                   |
| ------------------------ | ----------------------- |
| Speed and throughput     | From 10 Mbps to 40 Gbps |
| Average cost per node    | Least expensive         |
| Media and connector size | Small                   |
| Maximum cable length     | 100 m (30m for 40Gbps)  |
- Several categories of UTP cables exist:
	- Category 5:
		- Capable of transmitting data at speeds of up to 100 Mbps
	- Category 5e:
		- Used in networks running at speeds of up to 1000 Mbps (1 Gbps)
	- Category 6:
		- Comprises 4 pairs of 24-gauge copper wires, which can transmit data at speeds of up to 10 Gbps
	- Category 6a:
		- Used in networks running at speeds of up to 10 Gbps
	- Category 7:
		- Used in networks running at speeds of up to 10 Gbps
	- Category 8:
		- Used in networks running at speeds of up to 40 Gbps

#### RJ-45 Connector and Jack
- UTP cables are used with RJ-45 connectors
![[Pasted image 20241026121505.png]]
- RJ-45 plug is the male component, which is crimped at the end of the cable
	- Pin locations are numbered from 8 on the left to 1 on the right
- Jack is the female component in a network device, wall cubicle partition outlet or patch panel
	- Pin locations are numbered from 1 on the left to 8 on the right
- Structures cabling is installed during the building construction phase in modern business environments
	- The cables are routed from the wiring closet to the sockets in the walls or on office desks
	- To connect to the local network, you would connect the computer's network adaptor, to the wall socket by using UTP cable with a male RJ-45 connector on both ends

![[Pasted image 20241026121833.png]]
>Notice that the cable from the wall socket to the wiring closet is called horizontal cabling
>	- Vertical cabling is the term usually reserved for links between wiring closets
#### Power over Ethernet (PoE) #PoE
- Passes electric power along with data on Ethernet cabling
	- Allows a single Ethernet cable to provide both data connection and electric power to devices such as wireless access points, IP cameras and VoIP phones by using all 4 pairs in the Category 5 cable or above
#### Straight-Through or a Crossover UTP Cable ?
- Straight-through cables are primarily used to connect electrically unlike devices
- Crossover cables are used to connect electrically like devices
- E.g. the receive pin is the same on both devices, so it must be crossed to the transmit pin
![[Pasted image 20241026174316.png]]
>To tell the different between the 2 types, hold the ends of the cable next to each other, with the connector side of each end facing you
	- The cable is a straight-through cable if some of the wires on one end of the cable are crossed to a different pin on the other side of the cable
- When automatic medium-dependent interface crossover (auto-MDIX) is enabled on an interface, the interface automatically detects the required cable connection type (straight-through or crossover) and configures the connection appropriately
	- With auto-MDIX enables, you can use either type of cable to connect to other devices and the interface automatically corrects for any incorrect cabling
- The need for crossover cables is considered legacy as most devices now use straight-through cables and can internally cross-connect when a crossover is required #important 
![[Pasted image 20241026174623.png]]

#### Optical Fiber
![[Pasted image 20241026175105.png]]
- Is a flexible, transparent fiber that is made of very pure glass (silica) and is not much larger than human hair
	- Acts as a waveguide, or light pipe, to transmit light between the two ends of the fiber
- Optical fibers are widely used in fiber-optic communication, which permits transmission over longer distances and at higher bandwidths (data rates) than other forms of communication
- Fibers are used instead of metal wires because signals travel with less loss and immunity to EMI #EMI
- The 2 fundamental components that allow fiber to confine light are the core and the cladding
	- Most of light travels from the beginning to the end inside the core
	- The cladding around the core provides confinement
	- The diameters of the core may vary for various fiber types
	- The outer diameter of the cladding is a standard size of 125 micrometers
	- Standardizing the size means that component manufacturers can make connectors for all fiber-optic cables
- The buffer (coating) has nothing to do with the confinement of the light in the fiber
	- Its purpose is to protect the glass from scratches and moisture
		- The fiber-optic cable can be easily scratched and broken
	- If the fiber is scratches, the scratch could propagate and break the fiber
	- Another important role of the buffer is to keep the fiber dry

**Fiber Types**
![[Pasted image 20241026175548.png]]

| MMF Characteristics             | SMF Characteristics               |
| ------------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| LED transmitter is usually used | Laser transmitter is usually used |
| Lower bandwidth and speed       | Higher bandwidth and speed        |
| Shorter distances               | Longer distances                  |
| Less expensive                  | More expensive                    |

- Most significant difference between multimode fiber (MMF) and single-mode fiber (SMF) is in the ability to send light over a long distance at high bit rates
	- MMF is used for shorter distances, SMF is preferred for long distance communications
- Another significant difference is in the size of the core
	- The glass in the 2 fibers is the same and the index of refraction (a way of measuring the speed of light in a material) between the core and the cladding changes similarly
	- The diameter of the fiber cladding is also the same
	- However, the core is a different size, which affects how the light gets through the fiber
		- MMF supports multiple ways for the light from one source to travel through the fiber
			- Each path can be thought of as a mode
		- For SMF, the possible ways for the light to get through the fiber have been reduced to one, as a useful approximation
- MMF uses LED as a light source, which facilitates short-distance transmissions
- SMF uses a laser to generate the signal, which provides higher transmission rates

![[Pasted image 20241026194814.png]]
> Generally, organizations standardize on one type of connector, depending on the equipment that they commonly use, or they standardize per type of fiber (one for MMF and for SMF)

- There are 3 types of connector
	- Threaded
	- Bayonet
	- Push-pull
- Connectors are mode of the following materials:
	- Plastic sleeve
	- Metal
- Here is a list of the most common types of fiber connectors and their typical uses:
	- LC = for enterprise equipment and is commonly used on Small Form-Factor Pluggable (SFP) modules
	- SC = for enterprise equipment
	- ST = for patch panels (for their durability)
	- FC = is for patch panels and is used by service providers
	- MT-RJ = two-fiber connector (transmit and receive), has a form factor and is used for enterprise equipment
- Small Form Factor (SFF) connectors (E.g. LCs) are replacing the traditional connectors (E.g. SC) mainly to pack more connectors on the faceplate and, as a result, reduce system footprints

### Ethernet Frame Structure 
- Bits that are transmitted over an Ethernet LAN are organized into frames
	- Frame contains header information, trailer information and the actual data that is being transmitted
![[Pasted image 20241027100137.png]]
> Ethernet || frame is the most common type
> 	- This frame type is often used to send IP packets

- Fields of an Ethernet II frame:
	- Preamble = Consists of 8 bytes of alternating 1s and 0s that are used to synchronize the signals of the communicating computers
	- Destination Address (DA) = Contains the Media Access Control (MAC) address of the Network Interface Card (NIC) on the local network to which the frame is being sent
	- Source Address (SA) = Contains the MAC address of the sending computer
	- Type = Contains a code that identifies the network layer protocol
		- To identify the encapsulated protocol, the Type field uses a hexadecimal value called Ether-type
			- E.g. to identify that the Ethernet frame passenger is an IP packet, the Ether-Type is 0X0800
			- For an IPv6 packet, it is 0X86DD
			- Each protocol is identifies with a specific Ether-Type value
	- Payload = Contains the network layer data
		- If the data is shorter than the minimum length of 46 bytes, a string of extraneous bits is used to pad the field
			- The field is also known as data and padding
		- The maximum size of the payload (Maximum Transmission Unit (MTU)) is 1500 bytes
		- Adding the Ethernet protocol overhead, the maximum size of an Ethernet frame is 1518 bytes (Preamble is excluded)
			- Frames bigger than 1518 bytes are generally called jumbo frames
		- It is possible to change the MTU
			- Usually changes when some tunnelling technologies come into play
				- E.g. adding some tunnel protocol information
		- Because it is not possible to increase the space in the payload field, the MTU is reduced
			- E.g. Tunnel Generic Routing Encapsulation (GRE)
				- GRE adds 24 bytes protocol overhead (4 bytes of GRE info and 20 bytes for another IP header)
					- So the MTU is reduced automatically to 1476 byes
	- Frame Check Sequence (FCS) = includes a checking mechanism to help ensure that the frame of data has been transmitted without corruption
		- The checking mechanism that is being used is the Cyclic Redundancy Check (CRC)
### LAN Communication Types
- The 3 types of network communications are:
	- Unicast = Frame is sent from one host and is addressed to one specific destination
		- There is only 1 sender and receiver
		- Is the predominant form of transmission on LANs and within the Internet
	- Broadcast = frame is sent from one address to all other addresses
		- There is only 1 sender but the information is sent to all the connected receivers
		- Is used for sending the same message to all devices on the LAN
	- Multicast = information is sent to a specific group of devices or clients
		- Unlike broadcast, clients must be members of a multicast group to receive the information
![[Pasted image 20241027102706.png]]
> Multicast source can send a multicast stream to a group of devices thanks to the use of specific IP and MAC address
> 	- The receivers send Join messages to declare that they want to receive the multicast traffic destined to a specific multicast IP address
> 	- The source starts to send packets and only the receivers will accept the packets because they are listening to that specific multicast IP address, which represents a multicast group

- Two main protocols assist in the delivery of multicast packets:
	- Internet Group Management Protocol (IGMP)
		- IGMP works within the local LAN and it is responsible for handling the Join messages sent by the receivers and also ensure that multicast traffic is only sent to the multicast group destinations
	- Protocol-Independent Multicast (PIM)
		-  PIM is a multicast routing protocol that sets up multicast distribution trees for data packets to reach all the receivers that have joined the multicast group
- These protocols work together to build the path that allows the multicast source to send packets to the multicast protocols work together to build the path that allows the multicast source to send packets to the multicast receivers

### Mac Addresses
![[Pasted image 20241027104820.png]]
>Hexadecimal format = A, B, C, D, E, F = 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15

- A MAC address is composed of 12 hexadecimal digits, which means it has 48 bits
- There are 2 main components of a MAC address
	- First 24 bits constitute the Organizationally Unique Identifier (OUI)
	- Last 24 bits constitute the vendor assigned, end-station address:
		- 24-bit OUI = identifies the manufacturer of the NIX
			- IEEE regulates the assignment of the OUI numbers
			- Within the OUI, 2 bits have meaning only when used in the destination address field
				- Broadcast or multicast bit = least significant bit in the first octet of the MAC address is 1, it indicates to the receiving interface that the frame is destined for all (broadcast) or a group (multicast) end stations on the LAN segment
					- This bit is referred to as the Individual/Group (I/G) address bit
				- Locally administered address bit = second least significant bit of the first octet of the MAC addresses is referred to as a universally or locally (U/L) administered address bit
					- Normally the combination of the OUI and a 24-bit station address is universally unique
						- However, if the address is modified locally, this bit should be set to 1
		- 24-bit, vendor assigned, end-station address = uniquely identifies the Ethernet hardware
- There are 3 types of MAC Addresses:
	- Unicast MAC Address
		- Identifies only 1 NIC on the network and it is the Layer 2 destination of a Unicast transmission
![[Pasted image 20241027105857.png]]
			- E.g. 00:00:0c:43:2e:08
	- Broadcast MAC Address
		- Identifies all the NICs in the Layer 2 domain
			- The Broadcast MAC Address format is FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF and it is in Layer 2 destination of a Broadcast transmission
![[Pasted image 20241027110153.png]]
	- Multicast MAC Address
		- Identifies a group of NICs in the Layer 2 domain and it is the Layer 2 destination of a Multicast transmission
			- The Multicast MAC Address always begins with 01:00:5E and the last 23 bits are calculated from the Multicast Group IP Address
