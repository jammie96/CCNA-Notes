#### What is a Computer Network
- Computer network connections PCs, printers, servers, phones, cameras and othe rdevices
- Allows them to exchange data with each other
	- Facilitates information and resource sharing
	- 
##### 3 Categorizations of network
- Local-Area Networks (LANs)
	- Connects devices located relatively close together in a limited area
	- E.g. University campus network that can span several collocated buildings
- Wide-Area Networks (WANs) #WAN 
	- Cover a broad geographic area and are managed by service providers
	- E.g. telecommunication provider's network that interconnects multiple cities and states
- Metropolitan-Area Networks (MANs)
	- span a physical area larger than LAN but smaller than WAN, for instance, a city

##### Enterprise Network
- Medium-to-large enterprises often have networks spanning multiple locations, including a main office (Enterprise Campus) and remote sites like branch offices or home offices.
##### SOHO Networks #SOHO
- Small Office, Home Office (SOHO) networks typically connect to the main office via the internet.
##### Main Office Network
- This is usually a Local Area Network (LAN) that may cover multiple floors or buildings and often includes wireless networks managed by Wireless LAN Controllers (WLC).
##### Data Centers
- Enterprise Campuses usually have a data center for computational power, storage, and applications.
##### Internet Connectivity
 -  Enterprises connect to the internet with firewalls for protection.
##### Branch Offices
 - These have their own LANs with resources like printers and servers but rely on the main office for operations, connecting via Wide Area Networks (WAN) or the internet using routers as gateways.

##### Cisco Enterprise Architecture Model
- Networks are crucial for businesses and organizations, requiring security, resilience, and scalability. Network engineers use validated models like Ciscoâ€™s three-tier hierarchical network architecture, spine-leaf model, and Cisco Enterprise Architecture model to design layered network structures with specific functionalities such as LAN Access and LAN Core.

	LAN Access
	- This layer provides connectivity for end devices such as computers, printers, and IoT devices within a local area network (LAN), enabling users to access network resources and services efficiently.
	
	LAN Core
	- This layer serves as the backbone of the network, facilitating high-speed data transfer between different segments of the LAN, ensuring reliable communication and optimal performance across the network infrastructure.

- **Protocols**
	- Detailed rules for successful network communication.
- **Specifications**
	- Include voltage for signals, allowed messages, message structure, error handling, etc.
- **Data Exchange**
	- Follows well-defined protocol rules for internet communication.
- **Analogy**
	- Similar to two people talking the same language.
- **Creation** 
	- Developed by industry standards organizations.
- **Internet Protocol Suite**
	- Common base for services like email and file transfer.
- **RFCs (Request for Comments)**
	- Documents by standards bodies like IETF defining internet protocols and processes.

#### Components of a Computer Network

##### Endpoints #Endpoints 
- End-user devices
	- Include PCs, laptops, tablets, mobile phones, game consoles
	- File servers, printers, sensors, camera, manufacturing robots, smart home components
	- Virtualized ,do not exist as a separate hardware units #virtualized
		- One physical device is used to emulate multiple end devices
		- Emulated computer system operates as a separate physical unit and has its own operating system and other required software
		- Commonly applied to servers to optimize resource utilization
			- As server resources are often underutilized when they are implemented as separate physical units

#### Intermediary Devices
- Devices interconnect end devices or interconnect networks
- Perform different functions
	- E,.g. 
		- Regenerating and retransmitting signals
		- Choosing best paths between networks #OSPF
		- Classifying and forwarding data according to priorities
		- Filtering traffic to allow or deny it based on security settings #ACL
- Can be virtualized #virtualized

##### Switches
- Enable multiple endpoints to connect to the network
- Allows devices to communicate on the same network
- Attempts to forward messages from the sender so it is only received by the destination device
- Usually all the devices that connect to a single switch or a group of interconnected switches belong to a common network and can communicate directly with each other
- If an end device wants to communicate with a device that is on a different network, it requires "services" of a router, which connects different networks together

##### Routers #Routers
- Connects network and intelligently choose the best paths between networks
- Main function is to route traffic from one network to another
- Switches vs Routers:
	- Switch is a street that connects the houses, routers are crossroads of those streets
- Data sometimes "stops" at several routers before it is delivered to the final recipient
- Certain switches combine functionalities of routers and switches, called Layer 3 switches #Layer3Switches
##### Access Points (APs) #AccessPointsAP
- Nodes on a wireless network that allows other wireless devices to connect to a wired network
- Usually connects to a switch as a standalone devices
	- But also can be an integral component of the router itself
##### Wireless LAN Controllers (WLC) #WirelessLANControllersWLC
- Used by network administrators or network operation centers to facilitate the management of many APs
- Automatically manages the configuration of wireless APs

##### Cisco Secure Firewalls #Firewalls 
- Monitor and control the incoming and outgoing network traffic based on predetermined security rules
- Typically establishes a barrier between a trusted, secure internal network and another outside network, such as the Internet, that is assumed not to be secured or trusted

##### Intrusion Protection System (IPS) #IntrusionProtectionSystemsIPS
- Performs a deep analysis of network traffic while searching for signs that behaviour is suspicious or malicious
- If the IPS detects such behaviour, it can take protective action immediately
- An IPS and firewall can work in conjunction to defend a network

##### Management Services
- A modern management service offers centralized management that facilitates designing, provisioning and applying policies across a network
- It includes features for discovery and management of network inventory, management of software images, device configuration automation, network diagnostics and policy configuration
- It provides end-to-end network visibility and uses network insights to optimize the network
- E.g. Cisco Catalyst Center
