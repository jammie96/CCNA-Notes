#### What is a Computer Network
- Computer network connections PCs, printers, servers, phones, cameras and othe rdevices
- Allows them to exchange data with each other
	- Facilitates information and resource sharing
	- 
##### 3 Categorizations of network
- Local-Area Networks (LANs)
	- Connects devices located relatively close together in a limited area
	- E.g. University campus network that can span several collocated buildings
- Wide-Area Networks (WANs) #WAN 
	- Cover a broad geographic area and are managed by service providers
	- E.g. telecommunication provider's network that interconnects multiple cities and states
- Metropolitan-Area Networks (MANs)
	- span a physical area larger than LAN but smaller than WAN, for instance, a city

##### Enterprise Network
- Medium-to-large enterprises often have networks spanning multiple locations, including a main office (Enterprise Campus) and remote sites like branch offices or home offices.
##### SOHO Networks #SOHO
- Small Office, Home Office (SOHO) networks typically connect to the main office via the internet.
##### Main Office Network
- This is usually a Local Area Network (LAN) that may cover multiple floors or buildings and often includes wireless networks managed by Wireless LAN Controllers (WLC).
##### Data Centers
- Enterprise Campuses usually have a data center for computational power, storage, and applications.
##### Internet Connectivity
 -  Enterprises connect to the internet with firewalls for protection.
##### Branch Offices
 - These have their own LANs with resources like printers and servers but rely on the main office for operations, connecting via Wide Area Networks (WAN) or the internet using routers as gateways.

##### Cisco Enterprise Architecture Model
- Networks are crucial for businesses and organizations, requiring security, resilience, and scalability. Network engineers use validated models like Ciscoâ€™s three-tier hierarchical network architecture, spine-leaf model, and Cisco Enterprise Architecture model to design layered network structures with specific functionalities such as LAN Access and LAN Core.

	LAN Access
	- This layer provides connectivity for end devices such as computers, printers, and IoT devices within a local area network (LAN), enabling users to access network resources and services efficiently.
	
	LAN Core
	- This layer serves as the backbone of the network, facilitating high-speed data transfer between different segments of the LAN, ensuring reliable communication and optimal performance across the network infrastructure.

- **Protocols**
	- Detailed rules for successful network communication.
- **Specifications**
	- Include voltage for signals, allowed messages, message structure, error handling, etc.
- **Data Exchange**
	- Follows well-defined protocol rules for internet communication.
- **Analogy**
	- Similar to two people talking the same language.
- **Creation** 
	- Developed by industry standards organizations.
- **Internet Protocol Suite**
	- Common base for services like email and file transfer.
- **RFCs (Request for Comments)**
	- Documents by standards bodies like IETF defining internet protocols and processes.

#### Components of a Computer Network

>Sample image of a network

##### Endpoints #Endpoints 
- End-user devices
	- Include PCs, laptops, tablets, mobile phones, game consoles
	- File servers, printers, sensors, camera, manufacturing robots, smart home components
	- Virtualized ,do not exist as a separate hardware units #virtualization
		- One physical device is used to emulate multiple end devices
		- Emulated computer system operates as a separate physical unit and has its own operating system and other required software
		- Commonly applied to servers to optimize resource utilization
			- As server resources are often underutilized when they are implemented as separate physical units

#### Intermediary Devices
- Devices interconnect end devices or interconnect networks
- Perform different functions
	- E,.g. 
		- Regenerating and retransmitting signals
		- Choosing best paths between networks #OSPF
		- Classifying and forwarding data according to priorities
		- Filtering traffic to allow or deny it based on security settings #ACL
- Can be virtualized #virtualized

##### Switches
- Enable multiple endpoints to connect to the network
- Allows devices to communicate on the same network
- Attempts to forward messages from the sender so it is only received by the destination device
- Usually all the devices that connect to a single switch or a group of interconnected switches belong to a common network and can communicate directly with each other
- If an end device wants to communicate with a device that is on a different network, it requires "services" of a router, which connects different networks together

##### Routers #Routers
- Connects network and intelligently choose the best paths between networks
- Main function is to route traffic from one network to another
- Switches vs Routers:
	- Switch is a street that connects the houses, routers are crossroads of those streets
- Data sometimes "stops" at several routers before it is delivered to the final recipient
- Certain switches combine functionalities of routers and switches, called Layer 3 switches #Layer3Switches
##### Access Points (APs) #AccessPointsAP
- Nodes on a wireless network that allows other wireless devices to connect to a wired network
- Usually connects to a switch as a standalone devices
	- But also can be an integral component of the router itself
##### Wireless LAN Controllers (WLC) #WirelessLANControllersWLC
- Used by network administrators or network operation centers to facilitate the management of many APs
- Automatically manages the configuration of wireless APs

##### Cisco Secure Firewalls #Firewalls 
- Monitor and control the incoming and outgoing network traffic based on predetermined security rules
- Typically establishes a barrier between a trusted, secure internal network and another outside network, such as the Internet, that is assumed not to be secured or trusted

##### Intrusion Protection System (IPS) #IntrusionProtectionSystemsIPS
- Performs a deep analysis of network traffic while searching for signs that behaviour is suspicious or malicious
- If the IPS detects such behaviour, it can take protective action immediately
- An IPS and firewall can work in conjunction to defend a network

##### Management Services
- A modern management service offers centralized management that facilitates designing, provisioning and applying policies across a network
- It includes features for discovery and management of network inventory, management of software images, device configuration automation, network diagnostics and policy configuration
- It provides end-to-end network visibility and uses network insights to optimize the network
- E.g. Cisco Catalyst Center

#### Characteristics of a Network

##### Topology
- A network topology is the arrangement of its elements
- Gives insights into physical connections and data flows among devices
	- Data flows can be optimized

##### Bitrate or Bandwidth
- Bitrate measures the data rate in bits per second (bps) of a given link in a network
	- Often referred to as bandwidth or speed in device configurations
- Determined by the physical properties of the medium that propagates the signal - number of bits transmitted in a second
   	- Link bitrates are commonly around 1-10 gigabits per second (1-10 billion bits per second)
   	- 100-Gbps are also not uncommon

##### Availability
- Indicates how much time a network is accessible and operational
- Expressed in terms of the percentage of time the network is operational
  	- Calculated as a ratio of the time in minutes that the network is available and the total number of minutes over an agreed period, multiplied by 100
	- Ratio of uptime and total time, expressed in percentage
 - To ensure high availability, networks should be designed to limit the impact of failures and to allow quick recovery when a failure does occur
 - High availability design usually incorporates redundancy 
	- Redundant design includes extra elements, which serves as backups to the primary elements and take over the functionality if the primary element fails #redundancy
 - E.g. redundant links, components and devices

##### Reliability
- Indicates how well the network operates
	- Considers the ability of a network to operate without failures and with the intended performance for a specific time period
 		- Tells you how much you can count on the network to operate as you expect it to
- For a network to be reliable, the reliability of all its components should be considered
- Highly reliable networks are highly available, but a highly available network might not be highly reliable
  	- Its components might operate at lower performance levels
- Standard measure of reliability is the Mean Time Between Failures (MBTF)
	- Calculated as the ratio between total time in service and the number of failures
	- Not meeting the required performance level is considered a failure
 - Choosing highly reliable redundant components in network design increases both availability and reliability
![[Pasted image 20240924212324.png]]

##### Scalability
- Indicates how easily the network can accomodate more users and data transmission requirements without affecting current network performance

##### Security
- Tells how well the network is defended from potential threats

##### Quality of Service (QoS)
- Includes tools, mechanisms and architectures, which allows you to control how and when applications use network resources
- Essential for prioritizing traffic when the network is congested

##### Cost
- Indicates the general expense for the initial purchase of the network components and any costs associated with installing and maintaining these components
  
##### Virtualization
- Creates a software solution that emulates network services and functions
- Solves many of the networking challenges in today;s networks, helping organizations centrally automate and provision the network from a cental management point	


#### Physical Topology
- Refers to the physical layout of the devices and cabling
- Node is commonly used when discussing topology diagrams
	- Node is usually a device
 - 2 nodes might have the same physical topology but distances between nodes, physical interconnections, transmission rates or signal types may differ
 - A physical topology must be implemented using the media that is appropriate for it

##### Bus #bus
![[Pasted image 20240924212350.png]]
- Every workstation is connected to a common transmission mediu, a single cable, which is called a backbone or bus
- Advantages:
	- 
- Disadvantages:
	- 

##### Ring #ring
![[Pasted image 20240924212403.png]]
- Computers and other network are cabled in succession and the last device is connected to the first one to form a circle or a ring
- Each device is connected to exactly 2 neighbours and has no direct connection to a third
- When one node sends data to another, the data passes through each node that lies between them until it reaches the destination
- Advantages:
	- 
- Disadvantages:
	- 

##### Star #star
![[Pasted image 20240924212419.png]]
- Most common physical topology
- There is a central device to which all other network devices connect via point-to-point links
- Also called hub and spoke topology
- There are no direct physical connections among spoke devices
- This also includes star and extended star topologies
	- In an extended star topology, one or more spoke devices are replaced by a device with its own spokes
 	- Composed of multiple star topologies whose central devices are connected
- Advantages:
	- 
- Disadvantages:
	- 

##### Mesh #mesh
![[Pasted image 20240924212434.png]]
- A device can be connected to more than one other device
- For one node to reach others, there are multiple paths available
- Redundant links increase reliability and self healing
- In a full mesh, every node is connected to every other node
	- Partial mesh is the opposite
- Advantages:
	- 
- Disadvantages:
	- 

#### Logical Topology
![[Pasted image 20240924212450.png]]
> The diagram depicts logical topology between PC A and the Server

- The path which data travels from one point to the other
- In this example, data does not follow the shortest physical path, which would go through 2 switches
- The logical topology requires data to also travel through the router for the 2 devices to communicate
	- The logical topology would then be a star, where the router is a central device
- Determined by the intermediary devices and the protocols chosen to implement the network
	- The intermediary devices and entwork protocols determine how end devices access the media and how they exchange data
