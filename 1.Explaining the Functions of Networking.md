#### What is a Computer Network
- Computer network connections PCs, printers, servers, phones, cameras and othe rdevices
- Allows them to exchange data with each other
	- Facilitates information and resource sharing
	- 
##### 3 Categorizations of network
- Local-Area Networks (LANs)
	- Connects devices located relatively close together in a limited area
	- E.g. University campus network that can span several collocated buildings
- Wide-Area Networks (WANs) #WAN 
	- Cover a broad geographic area and are managed by service providers
	- E.g. telecommunication provider's network that interconnects multiple cities and states
- Metropolitan-Area Networks (MANs)
	- span a physical area larger than LAN but smaller than WAN, for instance, a city

##### Enterprise Network
- Medium-to-large enterprises often have networks spanning multiple locations, including a main office (Enterprise Campus) and remote sites like branch offices or home offices.
##### SOHO Networks #SOHO
- Small Office, Home Office (SOHO) networks typically connect to the main office via the internet.
##### Main Office Network
- This is usually a Local Area Network (LAN) that may cover multiple floors or buildings and often includes wireless networks managed by Wireless LAN Controllers (WLC).
##### Data Centers
- Enterprise Campuses usually have a data center for computational power, storage, and applications.
##### Internet Connectivity
 -  Enterprises connect to the internet with firewalls for protection.
##### Branch Offices
 - These have their own LANs with resources like printers and servers but rely on the main office for operations, connecting via Wide Area Networks (WAN) or the internet using routers as gateways.

##### Cisco Enterprise Architecture Model
- Networks are crucial for businesses and organizations, requiring security, resilience, and scalability. Network engineers use validated models like Ciscoâ€™s three-tier hierarchical network architecture, spine-leaf model, and Cisco Enterprise Architecture model to design layered network structures with specific functionalities such as LAN Access and LAN Core.

	LAN Access
	- This layer provides connectivity for end devices such as computers, printers, and IoT devices within a local area network (LAN), enabling users to access network resources and services efficiently.
	
	LAN Core
	- This layer serves as the backbone of the network, facilitating high-speed data transfer between different segments of the LAN, ensuring reliable communication and optimal performance across the network infrastructure.

- **Protocols**
	- Detailed rules for successful network communication.
- **Specifications**
	- Include voltage for signals, allowed messages, message structure, error handling, etc.
- **Data Exchange**
	- Follows well-defined protocol rules for internet communication.
- **Analogy**
	- Similar to two people talking the same language.
- **Creation** 
	- Developed by industry standards organizations.
- **Internet Protocol Suite**
	- Common base for services like email and file transfer.
- **RFCs (Request for Comments)**
	- Documents by standards bodies like IETF defining internet protocols and processes.
