#### What is a Computer Network
- Computer network connections PCs, printers, servers, phones, cameras and othe rdevices
- Allows them to exchange data with each other
	- Facilitates information and resource sharing
##### 3 Categorizations of network
- Local-Area Networks (LANs)
	- Connects devices located relatively close together in a limited area
	- E.g. University campus network that can span several collocated buildings
- Wide-Area Networks (WANs) #WAN 
	- Cover a broad geographic area and are managed by service providers
	- E.g. telecommunication provider's network that interconnects multiple cities and states
- Metropolitan-Area Networks (MANs)
	- span a physical area larger than LAN but smaller than WAN, for instance, a city

##### Enterprise Network
- Medium-to-large enterprises often have networks spanning multiple locations, including a main office (Enterprise Campus) and remote sites like branch offices or home offices.
##### SOHO Networks #SOHO
- Small Office, Home Office (SOHO) networks typically connect to the main office via the internet.
##### Main Office Network
- This is usually a Local Area Network (LAN) that may cover multiple floors or buildings and often includes wireless networks managed by Wireless LAN Controllers (WLC).
##### Data Centers
- Enterprise Campuses usually have a data center for computational power, storage, and applications.
##### Internet Connectivity
 -  Enterprises connect to the internet with firewalls for protection.
##### Branch Offices
 - These have their own LANs with resources like printers and servers but rely on the main office for operations, connecting via Wide Area Networks (WAN) or the internet using routers as gateways.

##### Cisco Enterprise Architecture Model
- Networks are crucial for businesses and organizations, requiring security, resilience, and scalability. Network engineers use validated models like Ciscoâ€™s three-tier hierarchical network architecture, spine-leaf model, and Cisco Enterprise Architecture model to design layered network structures with specific functionalities such as LAN Access and LAN Core.

	LAN Access
	- This layer provides connectivity for end devices such as computers, printers, and IoT devices within a local area network (LAN), enabling users to access network resources and services efficiently.
	
	LAN Core
	- This layer serves as the backbone of the network, facilitating high-speed data transfer between different segments of the LAN, ensuring reliable communication and optimal performance across the network infrastructure.

- **Protocols**
	- Detailed rules for successful network communication.
- **Specifications**
	- Include voltage for signals, allowed messages, message structure, error handling, etc.
- **Data Exchange**
	- Follows well-defined protocol rules for internet communication.
- **Analogy**
	- Similar to two people talking the same language.
- **Creation** 
	- Developed by industry standards organizations.
- **Internet Protocol Suite**
	- Common base for services like email and file transfer.
- **RFCs (Request for Comments)**
	- Documents by standards bodies like IETF defining internet protocols and processes.

#### Components of a Computer Network
![[Pasted image 20240922153821.png]]
>Sample image of a network

##### Endpoints #Endpoints 
- End-user devices
	- Include PCs, laptops, tablets, mobile phones, game consoles
	- File servers, printers, sensors, camera, manufacturing robots, smart home components
	- Virtualized ,do not exist as a separate hardware units #virtualization
		- One physical device is used to emulate multiple end devices
		- Emulated computer system operates as a separate physical unit and has its own operating system and other required software
		- Commonly applied to servers to optimize resource utilization
			- As server resources are often underutilized when they are implemented as separate physical units

#### Intermediary Devices
- Devices interconnect end devices or interconnect networks
- Perform different functions
	- E,.g. 
		- Regenerating and retransmitting signals
		- Choosing best paths between networks #OSPF
		- Classifying and forwarding data according to priorities
		- Filtering traffic to allow or deny it based on security settings #ACL
- Can be virtualized #virtualized

##### Switches
- Enable multiple endpoints to connect to the network
- Allows devices to communicate on the same network
- Attempts to forward messages from the sender so it is only received by the destination device
- Usually all the devices that connect to a single switch or a group of interconnected switches belong to a common network and can communicate directly with each other
- If an end device wants to communicate with a device that is on a different network, it requires "services" of a router, which connects different networks together

##### Routers #Routers
- Connects network and intelligently choose the best paths between networks
- Main function is to route traffic from one network to another
- Switches vs Routers:
	- Switch is a street that connects the houses, routers are crossroads of those streets
- Data sometimes "stops" at several routers before it is delivered to the final recipient

#### Layer 3 Switch #Layer3Switches 
- Certain switches combine functionalities of routers and switches, called Layer 3 switches 
	- Routing between departments
- Home Router -> Router + Switch + AP
##### Access Points (APs) #AccessPointsAP
- Nodes on a wireless network that allows other wireless devices to connect to a wired network
- Usually connects to a switch as a standalone devices
	- But also can be an integral component of the router itself
##### Wireless LAN Controllers (WLC) #WirelessLANControllersWLC
- Used by network administrators or network operation centers to facilitate the management of many APs
- Automatically manages the configuration of wireless APs

##### Cisco Secure Firewalls #Firewalls 
- Monitor and control the incoming and outgoing network traffic based on predetermined security rules
- Typically establishes a barrier between a trusted, secure internal network and another outside network, such as the Internet, that is assumed not to be secured or trusted

##### Intrusion Protection System (IPS) #IntrusionProtectionSystemsIPS
- Performs a deep analysis of network traffic while searching for signs that behaviour is suspicious or malicious
- If the IPS detects such behaviour, it can take protective action immediately
- An IPS and firewall can work in conjunction to defend a network

##### Management Services
- A modern management service offers centralized management that facilitates designing, provisioning and applying policies across a network
- It includes features for discovery and management of network inventory, management of software images, device configuration automation, network diagnostics and policy configuration
- It provides end-to-end network visibility and uses network insights to optimize the network
- E.g. Cisco Catalyst Center

#### Characteristics of a Network

##### Topology
- A network topology is the arrangement of its elements
- Gives insights into physical connections and data flows among devices
	- Data flows can be optimized

##### Bitrate or Bandwidth
- Bitrate measures the data rate in bits per second (bps) of a given link in a network
	- Often referred to as bandwidth or speed in device configurations
- Determined by the physical properties of the medium that propagates the signal - number of bits transmitted in a second
   	- Link bitrates are commonly around 1-10 gigabits per second (1-10 billion bits per second)
   	- 100-Gbps are also not uncommon

##### Availability
- Indicates how much time a network is accessible and operational
- Expressed in terms of the percentage of time the network is operational
  	- Calculated as a ratio of the time in minutes that the network is available and the total number of minutes over an agreed period, multiplied by 100
	- Ratio of uptime and total time, expressed in percentage
 - To ensure high availability, networks should be designed to limit the impact of failures and to allow quick recovery when a failure does occur
 - High availability design usually incorporates redundancy 
	- Redundant design includes extra elements, which serves as backups to the primary elements and take over the functionality if the primary element fails #redundancy
 - E.g. redundant links, components and devices

##### Reliability
- Indicates how well the network operates
	- Considers the ability of a network to operate without failures and with the intended performance for a specific time period
 		- Tells you how much you can count on the network to operate as you expect it to
- For a network to be reliable, the reliability of all its components should be considered
- Highly reliable networks are highly available, but a highly available network might not be highly reliable
  	- Its components might operate at lower performance levels
- Standard measure of reliability is the Mean Time Between Failures (MBTF)
	- Calculated as the ratio between total time in service and the number of failures
	- Not meeting the required performance level is considered a failure
 - Choosing highly reliable redundant components in network design increases both availability and reliability
![[Pasted image 20240924212324.png]]

##### Scalability
- Indicates how easily the network can accomodate more users and data transmission requirements without affecting current network performance

##### Security
- Tells how well the network is defended from potential threats

##### Quality of Service (QoS)
- Includes tools, mechanisms and architectures, which allows you to control how and when applications use network resources
- Essential for prioritizing traffic when the network is congested

##### Cost
- Indicates the general expense for the initial purchase of the network components and any costs associated with installing and maintaining these components
  
##### Virtualization
- Creates a software solution that emulates network services and functions
- Solves many of the networking challenges in today;s networks, helping organizations centrally automate and provision the network from a cental management point	


#### Physical Topology
- Refers to the physical layout of the devices and cabling
- Node is commonly used when discussing topology diagrams
	- Node is usually a device
 - 2 nodes might have the same physical topology but distances between nodes, physical interconnections, transmission rates or signal types may differ
 - A physical topology must be implemented using the media that is appropriate for it

##### Bus #bus
![[Pasted image 20240924212350.png]]
- Every workstation is connected to a common transmission mediu, a single cable, which is called a backbone or bus
- Advantages:
	- 
- Disadvantages:
	-  1 endpoint can only talk in any point in time

##### Ring #ring
![[Pasted image 20240924212403.png]]
- Computers and other network are cabled in succession and the last device is connected to the first one to form a circle or a ring
- Each device is connected to exactly 2 neighbours and has no direct connection to a third
- When one node sends data to another, the data passes through each node that lies between them until it reaches the destination
- Advantages:
	- 
- Disadvantages:
	- 

##### Star #star
![[Pasted image 20240924212419.png]]
- Most common physical topology
- There is a central device to which all other network devices connect via point-to-point links
- Also called hub and spoke topology
- There are no direct physical connections among spoke devices
- This also includes star and extended star topologies
	- In an extended star topology, one or more spoke devices are replaced by a device with its own spokes
 	- Composed of multiple star topologies whose central devices are connected
- Advantages:
	- 
- Disadvantages:
	-  1 point of failure, one person can only communicate

##### Mesh #mesh
![[Pasted image 20240924212434.png]]
- A device can be connected to more than one other device
- For one node to reach others, there are multiple paths available
- Redundant links increase reliability and self healing
- In a full mesh, every node is connected to every other node
	- Partial mesh is the opposite
- Usually used in WAN
- Advantages:
	-  High availability
- Disadvantages:
	-  High cost
	- Complicated

#### Logical Topology
![[Pasted image 20240924212450.png]]
> The diagram depicts logical topology between PC A and the Server

- The path which data travels from one point to the other
- In this example, data does not follow the shortest physical path, which would go through 2 switches
- The logical topology requires data to also travel through the router for the 2 devices to communicate
	- The logical topology would then be a star, where the router is a central device
- Determined by the intermediary devices and the protocols chosen to implement the network
	- The intermediary devices and entwork protocols determine how end devices access the media and how they exchange data


#### Interpreting a Network Diagram #important 
![[Pasted image 20240924212534.png]]
- Physical diagrams focus on how physical interconnections are laid out and include device interface labels and location identifiers
	- To indicate the physical ports to which media is connected
 - Logical network diagrams include encircling symbols (ovals, circles, rectangle) to indicate how devices or cables are grouped
 - These symbols further include device and network logical identifiers, such as addresses
 - Also indicate which networking processes are configured, such as routing protocols, and provide their basic parameters
 - Gi1/0/1 = slot# / sub-slot# / port#
 - Te1/4 = slot# / port#
 - Slot is typically an opening in a router or switch that allows you to install a module for extra functionality
	- Some fixed-port switches dont have modular slots
 	- Instead, all ports are assigned to the built-in default slot, slot 0
  		- Some modules can also include several smaller slots called sub-slots

| ---------------------- | ------------ | ------- |
| Ethernet               | E            | E0/0    |
| FastEthernet           | Fa           | Fa0/0   |

| FortyGigabitEthernet   | Fo           | Fo1/0/1 |
| HundredGigabitEthernet | Hu           | Hu1/0/2 |

#### Impact of User Applications on the Network
- Data traffic flowing in a network can be generated by end users or control traffic
	- User generate traffic by using applicaitons
 	- Control traffic can be generated by intermediary devices or by activities related to the operation, administration and management of the network
  - Usage of applications can affect network performance and vice versa
  - Usage translates to the user's perception of the quality of the provided service

##### Classifying Applications

###### Interactivity
- Interactivity presumes that a response is expected for the normal functioning of the application for a given request
- Important to evaluate how sensitive they are to delays

###### Real-time Responsiveness
- Expects a timely data serving
- E.g. football game video streaming or video conferencing
- Sensitive to delay, also commonly known as latency
- Latency refers to the total amount of time from the source sending data to the destination receiving it
	- Accounts for the propagation delay of signals through media, the time required for data processing on devices it crosses along the path
 	- Variation in latency is called jitter

###### Amount of data generated
- Some applications produce low quantity of data
- These do not require much bandwidth and are usually referred to as benign bandwidth applications
- The opposite are terms bandwidth greedy
  
###### Burstiness
- Applications that always generate a consistent amount of data are referred to as smooth or non-bursty applications
- Bursty applications at times create a small amount of data, but they can change behaviour for shorter periods
	- An example is web browsing, if you open a page in a browser that contains a lot of texts, a small amount of data is transferred
 		- But if downloading a huge ifle, the amount of data will increase during download

###### Drop sensitivity
- Packet loss is losing packets along the data path, which can severely degrade the application performance
- Some real-time applications are sensitive to the packet loss when using the network resources

###### Criticality to business
#insertpicturehere
- This aspect of an application is subjective in that it depends on someone's estimate of how valuable and important the application is to a business
- For instance, an enterpirse that relies on video surveillance to secure its premises might consider video traffic as a top priority, while another enterprise might consider it totally irrelevant

###### Batch applications
- Applications such as FTP and TFTP are considered batch applications
	- Both are used to send and receive files\
 - While bandwidth is important for batch applications, it is not critical
	- Even with low bandwidth, the download is completed eventually
 - Their principal characteristics are:
	- Typically do not require direct human interaction
 	- Bandwidth is important but not critical
    
###### Interactive applications
- Applications in which the user waits for a response to their actions are interactive
- Strict response times or bandwidth guarantees might not be required
- If the appropriate amount of bandwidth is not available, the transaction may take longer, but it will eventually complete
- The main characteristics of interactive applications are:
	- Typically support human-to-machine interaction
 	- Acceptable response times have differen values depending on how important the application is for business
  
###### Real-time Applications
- Applications such as voice and video that may also involve human interaction
	- Because of the amount of information that is transmitted, bandwidth is critical
 - Delay on the network can cause a problem, timely delivery of the data is crucial
 - QoS is a way of granting higher priority to certain types of data, such as VoIP #QoS
 - The main characteristics of the real-time applications are:
	- Typically support human-to-human interaction
 	- End-to-end latency is critical
