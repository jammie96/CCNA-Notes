### Physical Redundancy in a LAN
- Physical loops may occur in the network as part of a design strategy for redundancy in a switched network
- Adding additional switches to LANs can add the benefit of redundancy
	- Connecting 2 switches to the same network segments ensures continuous operation if there are problems with one of the segments
	- Redundancy can ensure the constant availability of the network
- However, when adding redundant physical links and additional switches, a physical loop is created and by spanning a single VLAN between connected switches, a Layer 2 loop is also created

 ![[Pasted image 20241127212656.png]]
>  Layer 2 LAN protocols (such as Ethernet) lack a mechanism for recognizing and eliminating endless looping of frames (as shown)
>	- Some Layer 3 protocols implement a Time To Live (TTL) or hop limit mechanism that limits the number of times that a Layer 3 networking device can retransmit a packet or limit how many Layer 3 devices a packet can traverse
>	- Lacking such a mechanism, Layer 2 devices would continue to retransmit looping traffic indefinitely

- Layer 2 loops affect performance in a switched LAN
- A loop-avoidance mechanism solves these problems and STP was developed for that purpose #STP

### Issues in Redundant Topologies #redundancy 
- In the absence of a protocol to monitor link forwarding states, a redundant switch topology is vulnerable to these conditions:
	- Continuous frame duplication
		- Without some loop-avoidance process, each switch floods broadcast, multicast and unknown unicast frames endlessly
		- Switched flood broadcast frames to all ports except the port on which the frame was received
			- The frames then duplicate and travel endlessly around the loop in all directions
			- The result of continuous broadcast frame duplication is called a broadcast storm
	- Multiple frame transmission
		- Multiple copies of unicast frames may be delivered to destination stations
		- Many protocols expect to receive only a single copy of each transmission
		- Multiple copies of the same frame can cause unrecoverable errors
	- MAC database instability
		- Instability in the content of the MAC address table results from the fact that different ports of the switch receive copies of the same frame
		- Data forwarding can be impaired when the switch consumes the resources that are coping with instability in the MAC address table

![[Pasted image 20241127214934.png]]
> The figure shows that no Layer 2 loop prevention mechanism is implemented
> 	- Suppose that host A sends a frame to host B
> 	- Host A resides on network Segment A and Host B resides on network segment B
> 	- Assume that none of the switches have learned the address of host B
> 		-  Host A transmits the frame destined for Host B on Segment A
> 		- Switch W receives the frame that is destined for Host B, learns the MAC address of Host A on Segment A and floods it out to Switches X and Y
> 		- Switch X and Switch Y both receive the frame from Host A (via Switch W) and correctly learn that Host A is on Segment 1 for Switch X and on Segment 2 for Switch Y
> 		- Switch X and Switch Y then forward the frame to Switch Z
> 		- Switch Z receives 2 copies of the frame from Host A: 1 through Switch X on Segment 4 and the other through Switch Y on Segment 4

- In the above example where no loop prevention mechanism exists, the result is that host B has received multiple copies of the frame, which can cause problems with the receiving application directly on the host B
- Switches X and Y now change their internal tables to indicate that host A is on segment 3 for switch X and on segment 4 for switch Y
	- The copies of the initial frame from host A being received on different segments of the switches results in MAC database instability
- Furthermore, f the initial frame from host A was a broadcast frame, then all switches forward the frame endlessly
	- Switches flood broadcast frames to all ports except the port on which the frame was received
	- The frames then duplicate and travel endlessly around the loop in all directions
		- They eventually would use all available network bandwidth and block transmission of other packets on both segments
		- This results in a broadcast storm

### Spanning Tree Operation
- The solution to prevent Layer 2 loops is STP
- STP enables the use of physical path redundancy while preventing the undesirable effects of active Layer 2 loops in the network
- By default, STP is turned on in Cisco Catalyst switches
- There are several varieties of STP
	- All variants of STP provide Layer 2 loop prevention by managing the physical paths to given network segments
- The original STP is an IEEE committee standard that is defined as 802.1D and was created for a bridged network using Ethernet bridges
	- Ethernet bridges are obsolete and replaced with Ethernet switches, so the devices running any variant of STP nowadays are switches
- However, STP terminology includes bridge even though it is being run on switches

![[Pasted image 20241128210401.png]]

- STP behaves in the following way:
	- STP uses bridge protocol data units (BPDUs) for communication between switches
	- STP forces certain ports into a blocked state so that they do not listen to, forward, or flood data frames
		- The overall effect is that only one path to each network segment is active at any time
	- If there is a connectivity problem with any active network segment, STP activates a previously inactive path, if one exists (changing the blocked port to the forwarding state)
- To prevent Layer 2 loops in a network, STP uses a reference point called the root bridge
	- The root bridge is the logical center of the spanning tree topology
- All paths that are not needed to reach the root bridge from anywhere in the network are placed in STP blocking mode
- The root bridge is chosen with an election
![[Pasted image 20241128210826.png]]
>- In the original STP, each switch has a unique 64-bit bridge ID (BID) that consists of the 16-bit bridge priority and 48-bit MAC address 
>- The bridge priority is a number between 0 and 65535 and the default on Cisco switches is 32768

![[Pasted image 20241128211732.png]]
>- In evolved variants of STP, like Cisco PVST+, RSTP or Multiple Spanning Tree Protocol (MSTP), the original bridge priority field in the BID is changed to include an Extended System ID
>	- This field carries information such as VLAN ID or instance number required for the evolved variants of STP to operate
>	- The bridge priority field in this case is 4 bits and the Extended System ID field is 12 bits
>	- In command outputs, you will either see this combination written as a 16-bit field, or as 2 components
>		- A 16-bit bridge priority where the lower 12 bits are binary 0
>		- A 12-bit Extended System ID
>	- In the latter case, the bridge priority is a number between 0 and 65536 in increments of 4096 and the default on Cisco switches is 32768

- The spanning tree algorithm steps are: #STP 
	1. All interfaces on all switches in the spanning tree topology start in blocked mode
	2. The switches elect a root bridge
		- The root bridge is selected based on the lowest BID (in all STP variants)
		- If all switches in the network have the same bridge priority, the switch with the lowest MAC address becomes the root bridge
			- You can only have one root bridge per network in an original STP and one root bridge per VLAN in Cisco PVST+
		- By default, if a switch that is elected as a root bridge fails, the switch with the next lowest BID becomes the new root bridge
		- Cisco enables the configuration of a primary and secondary root bridge
		- If a primary root bridge failure occurs, the configured secondary becomes the new root bridge
	3. Each nonroot switch determines a root port
		- The root port is the port with the best path to the root bridge
		- The root path cost value is used in this calculation
			- It is the cumulative STP cost of all links to the root bridge
		- The root port is the port with the lowest root path cost to the bridge
	4. On each segment, a designated port is selected
		- This is again calculated based on the lowest root path cost
		- The designated port on a segment is on the switch with the lowest root path cost
		- On root bridges, all switch ports are designated ports
		- Each network segment will have one designated port
	5. The root ports and designated ports transition to the forwarding state and any other ports (called nondesignated ports) stay in the blocking state

- The STP path cost depends on the speed of the link
- The below table shows the default STP link costs

| Data Rate | STP Cost (802.1D-1998) | STP Cost (802.1D-2004) |
| --------- | ---------------------- | ---------------------- |
| 4 Mbps    | 250                    | 5,000,000              |
| 10 Mbps   | 100                    | 2,000,000              |
| 16 Mbps   | 62                     | 1,250,000              |
| 100 Mbps  | 19                     | 200,000                |
| 2 Gbps    | 3                      | 10,000                 |
| 10 Gbps   | 2                      | 2000                   |

- The below table shows the summary of the STP port roles

| Port Role          | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

| Root Port          | The port exists on nonroot bridges. It is the switch port with the best path to the root bridge. Root ports forward traffic toward the root bridge and populate the MAC address table for network segments attached to that port. Only one root port is allowed per switch or per VLAN on Cisco PVST+                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| Designated port    | This port exists on root and nonroot bridges. For root bridges, all switch ports are designated ports. For nonroot bridges, a designated port is the switch port that will receive and forward frames toward the root bridge as needed. Only one designated port is allowed per segment. If multiple switches exist on the same segment, an election process determines the designated port and the corresponding switch port begins forwarding frames for the segment. Designated ports populate the MAC address table for the network segment attached to that port |
| Nondesignated port | The nondesignated port is a switch port that is blocking data frames and is not populating the MAC address table with the source addresses of frames that are seen on that segment                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| Disabled port      | The disabled port is a switch port that is shut down                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |


#### Spanning Tree Operation Example

![[Pasted image 20241201102735.png]]
- The first step in the spanning tree algorithm is the selection of a root bridge
- Initially, all switches assume that they are the root
- They start transmitting BPDUs with the Root ID field containing the same value as the bridge ID field

![[Pasted image 20241201103115.png]]
- When the switches start receiving BPDUs from the other switches, each switch compares the root ID in the received BPDUs against the value that it currently has recorded as the root ID
	- If the received value is lower than the recorded value, (which was originally the BID of that switch), the switch replaces the recorded value with the received value and starts transmitting this value in the Root ID field in its own BPDUs
- Eventually, all switches learn and record the BID of the switch that has the lowest BID
	- The switches all transmit this BID in the Root ID field of their BPDUs

![[Pasted image 20241201153301.png]]
> In this example, Switch B becomes the root bridge because it has the lowest BIS
> 	- Switch A and Switch B have the same priority but Switch B has a lower MAC address value

- When a switch recognizes that it is not the root (because it is receiving BPDUs that have a root ID value that is lower than its own BID), it marks the port on which it is receiving those BPDUs as its root port
- A switch could receive BPDUs on multiple ports
- In this case, the switch elects the port that has the lowest-cost path to the root as its root port
	- If 2 ports have an equal path cost to the root, the switch looks at the BID values in the received BPDUs to make a decision (where the lowest BID is considered best, similar to root bridge election)
	- If the root path cost and the BID in both BPDUs are the same because both ports are connected to the same upstream switch, the switch looks at the Port ID field in the received BPDUs and selects its root port based on the lowest value in that field
- By default, the cost that is associated with each port is related to its speed (the higher the interface bandwidth, the lower the cost) but the cost can be manually changed
![[Pasted image 20241201161338.png]]
- Switches A, C and D mark the ports that are directly connected to Switch B (which is the root bridge) as the root port
	- These directly connected ports on Switched A, C and D have the lowest cost to the root bridge
- After electing the root bridge and root ports, the switches determine which switch will have the designated port for each Ethernet segment
	- The switch with the designated port is called the designated bridge for the segment
	- This process is similar to the root bridge and root port elections
	- Each switch that is connected to a segment sends BPDUs out of the port that is connected to that segment, claiming to be the designated bridge for that segment
	- At this point, it considers its port to be a designated port
- When a switch starts receiving BPDUs from other switches on that segment, it compares the received values of the root path cost, BID and port ID fields (in that order) against the values in the BPDUs that it is sending out its own port
	- The switch stops transmitting BPDUs on the port and marks it as a nondesignated port if the other switch has lower values

![[Pasted image 20241201162831.png]]
- In the example, all ports on the root bridge (Switch B) are designated ports
	- The ports on Switch A that are connecting to Switch C and Switch D become designated ports, because Switch A has the lower root path cost
- To prevent Layer 2 loops while STP executes its algorithm, all ports start out in the blocking state
	- When STP marks a port as either a root port or a designated port, the algorithm starts to transition this port to the forwarding state and all nondesignated ports remain in the blocking state
- The original and rapid versions of STP both execute the same algorithm in the decision-making process
	- However, in the transition of a port from the blocking (or discarding, in rapid spanning tree terms) to the forwarding state, there is a big difference between those 2 spanning tree versions
	- Classic 802.1D would simply take 30 seconds to transition to the port to forwarding
	- The rapid spanning tree algorithm can use additional mechanisms to transition the port to forwarding in less than a second
- Although the order of the steps that are listed suggests that STP goes through them in a coordinated, sequential manner, that is not actually the case
	- These steps are going through in parallel
	- Each switch might adapt its selection of root bridge, root ports and designated ports as it receives new BPDUs
	- As the BPDUs are propagated through the network, all switches eventually have a consistent view of the topology of the network
	- When this stable state is reached, BPDUs are transmitted only by designated ports
	- However, all blocking ports are continuously listening for BPDUs that are sent every 2 seconds
		- If a blocking port stops receiving BPDUs, it will begin transition to the forwarding state

![[Pasted image 20241201170338.png]]
- There are 2 loops in the sample topology, meaning that 2 ports should be in the blocking state to break both loops
- The port on Switch C that is not directly connected to Switch B (root bridge) is blocked, because it is a nondesignated port
- The port on Switch D that is not directly connected to Switch B (root bridge) is also blocked because it is a nondesignated port
- STP Strength:
	- It removes any possible Layer 2 loops found in the topology
- STP Weakness:
	- All traffic must traverse the root bridge
		- If traffic needs to be sent from a source connected to Switch C to a destination connected to Switch D, traffic will be sent through the root bridge, Switch B
- Similar to OSPF, STP trees are considered the shortest path taken in the network
- In STP there is only one root and the shortest path is calculated from that device
	- Meanwhile in OSPF, each router is considered its own root and the Shortest Path First tree is calculated from it
- Due to this difference, in STP there is only one tree per topology while in OSPF, there is a tree for each router participating in OSPD in the topology
### Types of Spanning Tree Protocols
- The STP is a network protocol that ensures a loop-free topology
- Several varieties of STP exist
	- STP (IEEE 802.1D)
		- Legacy standard that provides a loop-free topology in a network with redundant links
		- STP creates a Common Spanning Tree (CST) that assumes one spanning tree instance for the entire bridged network, regardless of the number of VLANs
		- STP assumes one 802.1D spanning tree instance for the entire bridged network, regardless of the number of VLANs
			- Because only one instance exists, the CPU and memory requirements for this version are lower than for the other protocols
			- However, because of only one instance, there is only one root bridge and one tree
			- Traffic for all VLANs flows over the same path, which can lead to suboptimal traffic flows
		- Because of the limitations of 802.1D, this version is slow to converge
			- When a change in the topology occurs at a switch (e.g. when a link goes down), it generates a Topology Change Notification (TCN BPDU)
			- It then sends this TCN BPDU to the root bridge
			- When the root bridge receives this TCN BPDU, it will send an update to all non-root switches informing them of the update
			- It also informs them to change the aging timer for MAC addresses to 15 seconds
	- PVST+
		- Is a Cisco enhancement of STP that provides a separate 802.1D spanning tree instance for each VLAN that is configured in the network
		- The separate instance supports features like PortFast, UplinkFast, BackboneFast, BPDU guard, BPDU filter, root guard and loop guard to enhance security
		- Creating an instance for each VLAN increases the CPU and memory requirements but allows for per-VLAN root bridges
		- The use of PVST+ gives the administrator the ability to load balance traffic per VLAN
			- E.g. the root bridge for VLAN 10 could be Switch A and the root bridge for VLAN 20 could be Switch B
			- Convergence of this version is similar to the convergence of 802.1D, meaning that the topology change change mechanism is the same as 802.1D
				- However, convergence is per-VLAN
	- MSTP or IEEE 802.1s
		- Is an IEEE standard that is inspired by the earlier Cisco proprietary Multi-Instance STP (MISTP) implementation
		- MSTP maps multiple VLANs into the same spanning tree instance
		- To reduce the number of required STP instances, MSTP enables the mapping of multiple VLANs into the same spanning-tree instance with a common root bridge
		- The Cisco implementation of MSTP provides up to 16 instances of RSTP (802.1w) and combines many VLANs with the same physical and logical topology into a common RSTP instance
		- Each instance supports PortFast, BPDU guard, BPDU filter, root guard and loop guard security enhancements
		- The CPU and memory requirements of this version are lower than the requirements of Rapid PVST+ but are higher than the requirements of RSTP
		- The topology change mechanism in MSTP is similar to the one in RSTP
			- However, due to having multiple spanning-tree instances (MSTI) the calculation is done per MSTI
	- RSTP or IEEE 802.1w
		- Is an evolution of STP that provides faster convergence of STP
		- It redefines port roles and enhances BPDU exchanges
		- This version addresses many convergence issues but because it still provides a single instance of STP, it does not address the suboptimal traffic flow issues
		- To support that faster convergence, the CPU usage and memory requirements of this version are slightly higher than the requirements of the original STP but lower than the requirements of PVST+
			- When a topology change occurs at a switch, it sends a TCN BPDU to its neighbouring switches and flushes out the MAC Addresses in its MAC Address table
			- All switches receiving the TCN BPDU will repeat this until all switches have done so
				- Because switches do not wait for a BPDU from the root switch before aging out MAC Addresses, this causes the network to converge faster than in classic STP
	- Rapid PVST+ 
		- Is a Cisco enhancement of RSTP that uses PVST+ 
		- Rapid PVST+ provides a separate instance of 802.1w per VLAN
		- This version addresses both the convergence issues and the suboptimal traffic flow issues
		- However this version has the largest CPU and memory requirements
		- The topology change mechanism in Rapid PVST+ is the same as in RSTP, except it is done per VLAN
- When Cisco documentation and this course refer to implementing RSTP, they are referring to the Cisco RSTP implementation, Rapid PVST+

#### Comparison of Spanning Tree Protocols #STP 

| Protocol    | Standard | Resources Needed | Convergence | Number of Trees    |
| ----------- | -------- | ---------------- | ----------- | ------------------ |
| STP         | 802.1D   | Low              | Slow        | One                |
| PVST+       | Cisco    | High             | Slow        | One for every VLAN |
| RSTP        | 802.1w   | Medium           | Fast        | One                |
| Rapid PVST+ | Cisco    | Very High        | Fast        | One for every VLAN |
| MSTP        | 802.1s   | Medium or High   | Fast        | Om                 |

#### Default Spanning Tree Configuration
- Default spanning tree configuration for Cisco Catalyst switches includes the following characteristics:
	- PVST+
	- Enabled on all ports in VLAN 1
	- Slower convergence after topology change than with RSTP
- The default spanning tree mode for Cisco Catalyst switches is PVST+, which is enabled on all ports
- PVST+ has much slower convergence after a topology change than the Rapid PVST but requires less CPU and memory resources to compute the shortest path tree upon topology changes
