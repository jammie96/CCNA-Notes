### Physical Redundancy in a LAN
- Physical loops may occur in the network as part of a design strategy for redundancy in a switched network
- Adding additional switches to LANs can add the benefit of redundancy
	- Connecting 2 switches to the same network segments ensures continuous operation if there are problems with one of the segments
	- Redundancy can ensure the constant availability of the network
- However, when adding redundant physical links and additional switches, a physical loop is created and by spanning a single VLAN between connected switches, a Layer 2 loop is also created

>  Layer 2 LAN protocols (such as Ethernet) lack a mechanism for recognizing and eliminating endless looping of frames (as shown)
>	- Some Layer 3 protocols implement a Time To Live (TTL) or hop limit mechanism that limits the number of times that a Layer 3 networking device can retransmit a packet or limit how many Layer 3 devices a packet can traverse
>	- Lacking such a mechanism, Layer 2 devices would continue to retransmit looping traffic indefinitely

- Layer 2 loops affect performance in a switched LAN
- A loop-avoidance mechanism solves these problems and STP was developed for that purpose #STP

### Issues in Redundant Topologies #redundancy 
- In the absence of a protocol to monitor link forwarding states, a redundant switch topology is vulnerable to these conditions:
	- Continuous frame duplication
		- Without some loop-avoidance process, each switch floods broadcast, multicast and unknown unicast frames endlessly
		- Switched flood broadcast frames to all ports except the port on which the frame was received
			- The frames then duplicate and travel endlessly around the loop in all directions
			- The result of continuous broadcast frame duplication is called a broadcast storm
	- Multiple frame transmission
		- Multiple copies of unicast frames may be delivered to destination stations
		- Many protocols expect to receive only a single copy of each transmission
		- Multiple copies of the same frame can cause unrecoverable errors
	- MAC database instability
		- Instability in the content of the MAC address table results from the fact that different ports of the switch receive copies of the same frame
		- Data forwarding can be impaired when the switch consumes the resources that are coping with instability in the MAC address table

> The figure shows that no Layer 2 loop prevention mechanism is implemented
> 	- Suppose that host A sends a frame to host B
> 	- Host A resides on network Segment A and Host B resides on network segment B
> 	- Assume that none of the switches have learned the address of host B
> 		-  Host A transmits the frame destined for Host B on Segment A
> 		- Switch W receives the frame that is destined for Host B, learns the MAC address of Host A on Segment A and floods it out to Switches X and Y
> 		- Switch X and Switch Y both receive the frame from Host A (via Switch W) and correctly learn that Host A is on Segment 1 for Switch X and on Segment 2 for Switch Y
> 		- Switch X and Switch Y then forward the frame to Switch Z
> 		- Switch Z receives 2 copies of the frame from Host A: 1 through Switch X on Segment 4 and the other through Switch Y on Segment 4

- In the above example where no loop prevention mechanism exists, the result is that host B has received multiple copies of the frame, which can cause problems with the receiving application directly on the host B
- Switches X and Y now change their internal tables to indicate that host A is on segment 3 for switch X and on segment 4 for switch Y
	- The copies of the initial frame from host A being received on different segments of the switches results in MAC database instability
- Furthermore, f the initial frame from host A was a broadcast frame, then all switches forward the frame endlessly
	- Switches flood broadcast frames to all ports except the port on which the frame was received
	- The frames then duplicate and travel endlessly around the loop in all directions
		- They eventually would use all available network bandwidth and block transmission of other packets on both segments
		- This results in a broadcast storm
