- LAN is a network of endpoints and other components that are located relatively close together in a limited area #LAN
- LANs can vary widely in size
	- May consist of only 2 computers in a home office or small business, or it may include hundreds of computers in a large corporate office or multiple buildings
	- Organizations or individuals typically build and own the whole infrastructure, all the way down to the physical cabling
- Defining characteristics of LANs, in contrast to WANs, include their typically higher data transfer rates, smaller geographic area and the lack of need for leased telecommunication lines
- WAN is a data communications network that provides access to other networks over a large geographical area #WAN 
	- WANs use facilitates that an ISP or carriers, such as telephone or cable company, provides
	- The provider connects locations of an organization to each other, to locations of other organizations, to external services and remote users
	- WANs carry various traffic types such as voice, data and video
##### Functions of LAN
###### Data and applications
- When users are connected through a network, they can share files and even software applications
- This capability makes data more easily available and promotes more efficient collaboration on work projects

###### Resources
- The resources that can be shared include input devices, such as cameras and output devices, such as printers

###### Communication path to other networks
- If a resource is not available locally, the LAN can provide connectivity via a gateway to remote resources, such as the Internet
#### LAN Components #LAN

##### Hosts
- Include any device that can send or receive data on the LAN
- Sometimes called endpoints
##### Interconnections
- Allows data to travel from one point to another in the network
- Include: Network Interface Cards (NICs) & Network Media
###### Network Interface Cards (NICs)
- Translate the data that is produced by the device into a frame format that can be transmitted over the LAN
- Connect a device to the LAN over copper cable, fiber-optic cable or wireless communication
###### Network Media 
- Traditional LANs = Data was primarily transmitted over copper and fiber-optic cables
- Moden LANs = Include wireless LAN (WLAN)

##### Network Devices
- Responsible for data delivery between hosts
###### Ethernet Switches #Switch
- Forms the aggregation point of LANs
- Ethernet switches operate at Layer 2 of the Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) model and provide intelligent distribution of frames within the LAN
###### Routers #Routers 
- Sometimes called gateways, provide means to connect LAN segments and provide connectivity to the Internet
- Routers operate at Layer 3 of the OSI model
###### Access Points (APs) #AccessPointsAP 
- Provide wireless connectivity to LAN devices
- Operate at Layer 2 of the OSI model

##### Protocols
- Rules that govern how data is transmitted between components of a network
- Commonly used in LAN protocols:
	- Ethernet protocols (IEEE 802.2 and IEEE 802.3)
	- IP
	- TCP
	- UDP
	- Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) for IPv4 and Neighbor Discovery Protocol (NDP) for IPv6
	- Common Internet File System (CIFs)
	- DHCP

#### Need for Switches #Switch 
- Switches were introduced to LANs to divide a network into segments
![[Pasted image 20240930173554.png]]
> Segment is a network connection that is made by a single unbroken network cable

- When network devices had few network segments, endpoints shared the same media
	- Before switches, end devices were connected by hub #hub
	- Hub is a Layer 1 device that acts as a simple electric repeater that puts all the devices that are connected to it on the same media
	- Network segments that share the same media are known as collision domains as frames may collide with each other
![[Pasted image 20240930174220.png]]
- A network collision occurs when 2 or more devices connected by a shared medium try to communicate at the same time #NetworkCollision
	- In a collision domain, only 1 device was able to transmit at the time, while the other devices had to wait before transmitting to avoid collisions
- The total bandwidth was shared across all host devices on shared media
- Collision also decrease network efficiency

##### Causes of network congestion

###### Increasingly powerful computer and network technologies
- CPUs, buses and peripherals are consistently becoming faster and more powerful, therefore they can send more data at higher rates through the network
###### Increasing volume of network traffic
- Network traffic is now more common, as remote resources are used and are even necessary to carry out basic work
###### High-bandwidth applications
- Software applications are becoming richer in their functionality and are requiring more bandwidth to process
- Applications such as desktop publishing, engineering design, VoD, e-learning and streaming video all require considerable processing power and speed
- This puts a large burden on networks to manage the transmission of their files and requires sharing of the applications among users


#### Characteristics and Features of Switches #Switch 

![[Pasted image 20240930174929.png]]
> - Each switch port represents a segment
> - By default, a switch and all interconnected switches belong to a single LAN

##### Functions of Switches
- Main purpose of switch is to forward frames as fast and efficiently as possible
- Operate at the link layer of the TCP/IP protocol suite
- Selectively forward individual frames
- Have many ports to segment a large LAN into many smaller segments
- Have high speed and support various port speeds

##### Benefits of Switches

###### Dedicated communication between devices

###### Multiple simultaneous conversations

###### Full-duplex communication

###### Media-rate adaptation


##### Important characteristics of switches

###### High port density

###### Large frame buffers

###### Port speed

###### Fast Internal switching

###### Low per-port cost
