Scenario:
- You have just been tasked with optimizing network efficiency within your company network
- There is a suspicion that traffic from some PCs is perhaps taking a suboptimal route
- The traffic appears to route through a branch office before reaching the internet, which is causing unnecessary delays and bandwidth issues
- Your mission is to investigate these network paths and identify any issues

- Traffic might be inadvertently routed through the branch office due to misconfigurations in routing protocols or incorrect static route entries
- Changes in the network topology or the integration of new devices and services could have altered optimal routing paths without corresponding updates to routing configurations
- Limited visibility into all network segments might obscure the full path that packets take, complicating efforts to diagnose and correct the suboptimal routing

> According to the network documentation, the PC should take the optimal path to reach the internet
> 	- How can you verify this and confirm any routing issues relating to packet delivery?

### Layer 2 Addressing
- Layer 2 Ethernet LANs have the following characteristics:
	- They use MAC addresses
	- They identify end devices in the LAN
	- They enable the packet to be carried by the local media across each segment

- Layer 2 defines how data is formatted for transmission and how access to the physical media is controlled
- Layer 2 devices provide an interface with the physical media
	- E.g. Network Interface Cards (NICs) installed in a host
- Device-to-device communications require Layer 2 addresses, also known as physical addresses
	- E.g. Ethernet physical addresses or MAC addresses are embedded in Ethernet NIC in end devices, such as hosts
- Although MAC addresses are unique, physical addresses are not hierarchical
	- They are associated with a particular device, regardless of its location or connected network
	- These Layer 2 addresses have no meaning outside the local network media
	- They are used to locate the end devices in the local physical network on the data link layer
	- An Ethernet MAC address is a two-part, 48-bit binary value that is expressed as 12 hexadecimal digits
		- The address formats might appear like 00-05-9A-3C-78-00 or 00:05:9A:3C:78:00
- All devices that are connected to an Ethernet LAN have MAC-addressed interfaces
	- The NIC uses the MAC address in received frames to determine if a message should be passed to the upper layers for processing
	- The MAC address is permanently encoded to a ROM chip on a NIC
	- The MAC address is made up of the Organizationally Unique Identifier (OUI) and the vendor assignment number
- Switches also have MAC addresses but a device on sends a frame to these addresses when communicating with the switch, e.g. for management
	- Otherwise frames are addressed for other devices and the switch forwards the frames to those devices
