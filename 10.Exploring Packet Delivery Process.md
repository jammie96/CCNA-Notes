Scenario:
- You have just been tasked with optimizing network efficiency within your company network
- There is a suspicion that traffic from some PCs is perhaps taking a suboptimal route
- The traffic appears to route through a branch office before reaching the internet, which is causing unnecessary delays and bandwidth issues
- Your mission is to investigate these network paths and identify any issues

- Traffic might be inadvertently routed through the branch office due to misconfigurations in routing protocols or incorrect static route entries
- Changes in the network topology or the integration of new devices and services could have altered optimal routing paths without corresponding updates to routing configurations
- Limited visibility into all network segments might obscure the full path that packets take, complicating efforts to diagnose and correct the suboptimal routing

> According to the network documentation, the PC should take the optimal path to reach the internet
> 	- How can you verify this and confirm any routing issues relating to packet delivery?

### Layer 2 Addressing
- Layer 2 Ethernet LANs have the following characteristics:
	- They use MAC addresses
	- They identify end devices in the LAN
	- They enable the packet to be carried by the local media across each segment

![[Pasted image 20241104205829.png]]

- Layer 2 defines how data is formatted for transmission and how access to the physical media is controlled
- Layer 2 devices provide an interface with the physical media
	- E.g. Network Interface Cards (NICs) installed in a host
- Device-to-device communications require Layer 2 addresses, also known as physical addresses
	- E.g. Ethernet physical addresses or MAC addresses are embedded in Ethernet NIC in end devices, such as hosts
- Although MAC addresses are unique, physical addresses are not hierarchical
	- They are associated with a particular device, regardless of its location or connected network
	- These Layer 2 addresses have no meaning outside the local network media
	- They are used to locate the end devices in the local physical network on the data link layer
	- An Ethernet MAC address is a two-part, 48-bit binary value that is expressed as 12 hexadecimal digits
		- The address formats might appear like 00-05-9A-3C-78-00 or 00:05:9A:3C:78:00
- All devices that are connected to an Ethernet LAN have MAC-addressed interfaces
	- The NIC uses the MAC address in received frames to determine if a message should be passed to the upper layers for processing
	- The MAC address is permanently encoded to a ROM chip on a NIC
	- The MAC address is made up of the Organizationally Unique Identifier (OUI) and the vendor assignment number
- Switches also have MAC addresses but a device on sends a frame to these addresses when communicating with the switch, e.g. for management
	- Otherwise frames are addressed for other devices and the switch forwards the frames to those devices

>The figure shows the L2 addresses on 2 PCs and a router
>Note that the router has different MAC addresses on each interface

### Layer 3 Addressing
![[Pasted image 20241105204342.png]]
- Layer 3 provides connectivity and path selection between 2 host systems located on geographically separated routes
	- At the boundary of each local network, an intermediary network device, usually a router, de-encapsulated the frame to read the destination address contained in the packet's header (Layer 3 Protocol Data Unit (PDU))
- Routers use the network identifies portion of this address to determine which path to use to reach the destination host
	- Once the path is determined, the router encapsulates the packet in a new frame and sends it toward the destination end device
- Layer 3 addresses must include identifiers that enable intermediary network devices to locate the network that different hosts belong to
	- In the TCP/IP protocol suite, every IP host address contains information about the network where the host is located
- Intermediary devices that connect networks are routers #Routers 
	- The role of the router is to select paths and direct packets toward a destination
		- This process is known as routing
	- A router uses a list of paths located in a routing table to determine where to send data
- Layer 3 addresses are assigned to end devices such as hosts and network devices that provide Layer 3 functions
	- The router has its own Layer 3 address on each interface
	- Each network device that provides a Layer 3 function maintains a routing table

![[Pasted image 20241105204456.png]]
> The 2 router interfaces belong to different networks
> 	- The left interface and the directly connected PC belong to the 192.168.3.0/24 network
> 	- The right interface and the directly connected PC belong to the 192.168.4.0/24 network
> For devices in different IP networks, a Layer 3 device is needed to router traffic between them
### Default Gateways
![[Pasted image 20241105205329.png]]
- A source host can communicate directly (without a router) with a destination host only if the 2 hosts are on the same subnet
	- If they are on different subnet, the sending host must send the data to its default gateway, which will forward the data to the destination
- The default gateway is an address on a router (or Layer 3 switch) connected to the same subnet that the source host is on
- Before a host can send a packet to its destination, it must first determine if the destination address is on its local subnet or not
	- It uses the subnet mask in this determination
	- The subnet mask describes which portion of an IPv4 address refers to the network or subnet and which part refers to the host
- The source host first does an AND operation between its own IPv4 address and subnet mask to arrive at its local subnet address
	- To determine if the destination address is on the same subnet, the source host then does an AND operation between the destination IPv4 address and the source's subnet mask
		- This is because it does not know the subnet mask of the destination address
		- And if the devices are on the same subnet, they must have the same mask
	- If the resulting subnet address is the same, it knows the source and destination are on the same subnet
		- Otherwise, they are on different subnets
- E.g. IPv4 host 10.10.1.241/24 is on the 10.10.1.0/24 subnet
	- If the host that it wants to communicate with is 10.10.1.175, it knows that this IPv4 host is also on the local 10.10.1.0/24 subnet
- If the source and destination devices are on the same subnet, then the source can deliver the packet directly
	- If they are on different subnets, then the packets must be forwarded to the default gateway, which will forward to its destination
- The default gateway address must have the same network and subnet portion as the local host address
	- In other words, the default gateway must be on the same subnet as the local host

![[Pasted image 20241105211244.png]]
- Host is configured with the address of their default gateway
	- On a Windows computer, the Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) Properties tools are used to enter the default gateway IP address if you need to set the network parameters manually
	- These parameters may also be learned automatically

### Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) #ARP 
- When a device sends a packet to a destination, it encapsulates the packet into a frame
	- The packet contains IPv4 addresses and the frame contains MAC addresses
 - Therefore, there must be a way to map an IPv4 address to a MAC address
	- E.g. if enter ping **ping 10.1.1.3**, the MAC address of 10.1.1.3 must be included in the destination MAC address field of the frame that is sent
 - To determine the MAC address of the device with an IPv4 address 10.1.1.3, a process is performed by a Layer 2 protocol called Address Resolution Protocol (ARP)

- ARP provides 2 essential services:
	- Address resolution
 		- Mapping IPv4 addresses to MAC addresses on a network
	- Caching
 		- Locally storing MAC addresses that are learned via ARP
- The term address resolution in ARP refers to the process of binding or mapping the IPv4 address of a remote device to its MAC address
	- ARP sends a broadcast message to all devices on the local network
 		- This message includes its own IPv4 address and the destination IPv4 address
- The message asks the device on which the destination IPv4 address resides to respond with its MAC address
- The address resolution procedure is completed when the originator receives the reply frame, which contains the required MAC address and updates its table containing all the current bindings

### Using ARP to Resolve the MAC of a Local IPv4 Address
- Because ARP is a Layer 2 protocol, its scope is limited to the LAN
- If the source and destinaiton devices are on the same subnet, then the source can use ARP to determine the destination's MAC address
<insert picture here>
	- E.g. an IPv4 host 10.10.1.241/24 is on the 10.10.1.0/24 subnet
 		- The host wants to communicate with another device with the IP address 10.10.1.175
		- The host determines that the destination device is also on the local 10.10.1.0/24 subnet and it can use ARP to determine its MAC address to establish communication

<insert second picture>
> The output shows the Wireshark analysis of the ARP messages
> 	- The first example shows the ARP request sent as a broadcast to find out the MAC address of IPv4 host 10.10.1.175
> 	- The second ARP message shows the ARP reply including the MAC address of the host, which is 00:bc:22:a8:e0:a0

<insert third picture>
> A more detailed output of the ARP request
> Notice that the host's MAC address 00:bc:22:a8:e0:a0 appears twice
> Once in the Ethernet frame as a source and once in the payload field (Info)
> It appears in the source field because the request message is a broadcast sourced from the host
> 	- However, the destination cannot learn the MAC address from the frame field because it is discarded during the decapsulation process
> 	- Therefore, the MAC address of the host is also put in the ARP payload, so the ARP protocol on the destination device can retrieve the MAC address and store it in its ARP cache

### Using ARP to Resolve the MAC of a Remote IPv4 Address
<insert fourth picture>
- If the source and destination are not on the same subnet, then the source uses ARP to determine the default gateway's MAC address
	- E.g. when the source host 10.10.1.241 wants to communicate with the destination host 10.10.2.55, it compare this IPv4 address againt its subnet mask and discovers that the host is on a different IPv4 subnet (10.10.2.0/24)
 - When a host wants to send data to a device that is on another network or subnet, it encapsulated the packet in a frame addressed to its default gateway
	- So, the destination MAC address in the frame needs to be the MAC address of the default gateway
 - In this situation, the source must send an ARP request to find the MAC address of the default gateway
	- In this example, the host 10.10.1.241 sends a broadcast with an ARP Request for the MAC address of 10.10.1.1

<insert fifth output picture>
> The following output shows the Wireshark analysis of ARP messages
> You can see an ARP request sent as a broadcast to find out the MAC address of IPv4 host 10.10.1.1
> In the second ARP message, you can see the ARP reply showing that the MAC address of the default gateway is  00:25:b5:9c:34:27

### Understanding the ARP cache
- Each IPv4 device on a network segment maintains a table in memorym the ARP table or ARP cache
- The purpose of this table is to cache recent IPv4 addresses to MAC address bindings
- When a host wants to transmit data to another host on the same subnet, it searches the ARP table to see if there is an entry
	- If there is an entry, the host uses it
 	- If there is no entry, the IPv4 host sends an ARP broadcast requesting resolution
 - By caching recent bindings, ARP broadcasts can be avoided for any mappings in the cache
 - Without the ARP cache, each IPv4 host would have to send an ARP broadcast each time it wanted to communicate with another IPv4 host
 - Each entry, or row, of the ARP table has a pair or values - an IPv4 address and a MAC address
	- The relationship between the 2 values is a map, which means you can locate an IPv4 address in the table and discover the corresponding MAC address
 - The ARP table caches the mapping for the devices on the local LAN, including the default gateway
 - The device creates and maintains the ARP table dynamically, adding and changing address relationships as they are used on the local host
	- The entries in an ARP table expire after a while, the default expiry time for Cisco devices is 4 hours
 	- Other OS might have different value, Windows uses a random value between 15 and 45 seconds
  - The timeout ensures that the table does not contain information for systems that may be switched off or moved
  - Wehn the local host wants to transmit data again, the entry in the ARP table is generated through the ARP process
  - If no device responds to the ARP request, the original packet is dropped because a frame to put the packet in cannot be created without the destination MAC address

<insert sixth picture here>
> On a Windows PC, the **arp -s** command displays the current ARP table for all interfaces on the PC

<insert seventh picture here>
> To limit the output of the **arp** command to a single interface, use the **arp -a -N <IP Address> command

<insert eigth picture here>
> To display the ARP table on a Cisco IOS router, use the **show ip arp** or **show arp** EXEC command, the output is the same

- The proper syntax to display the ARP table is to **show ip arp <IP Address> <Host name> <MAC Address> <interface type number>
